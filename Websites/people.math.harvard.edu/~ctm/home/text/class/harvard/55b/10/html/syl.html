<b> Prerequisites: </b>
Commitment to a demanding course, strong interest in mathematics,
and familiarity with proofs and abstract reasoning.
Qualified students from Math 25a are welcome to 55b; please consult with
the instructor after completing the first few homeworks.

<br><br>

<img src="greenball.gif"> 
<b> Topics. </b> 
This course will provide a rigorous introduction to 
real and complex analysis.

<p>
This course covers the equivalent of Math 25b and 113, and prepares
students for Math 114 and other advanced courses in analysis.
<br><br>

<b> Reading and Lectures. </b>
Students are responsible for all topics covered in
the readings and lectures.
Assigned material should be read <em> before </em>
coming to class.  Lectures may go beyond the
reading, and not every topic in the reading will be
covered in class.  
<em> Absorbing new or additional topics through independent study is an important
part of the course. </em>
<br><br>

<img src="greenball.gif">
<b> Homework. </b>
Homework will be assigned every week.
It is due at the beginning of class.
<em> Late homework will not be accepted. </em>
Collaboration between students is encouraged, but you must write your own solutions, understand them and give credit to your collaborators. 
Please use only the texts and your course notes for homework.
<br><br>

<img src="greenball.gif">
<b> Midterms. </b>
There will be one in-class, one hour midterm.
<br><br>

<img src="greenball.gif">
<b> Final. </b>
There will be a take-home final exam, to be completed
during reading period.
<br><br>

<img src="greenball.gif">
<b> Grades. </b>
Grades will be based on homework (40%), the in-class midterm (20%) and the
take-home final (40%).
