Cofactors and other minors

Let <EM>A</EM> be a square matrix of order <EM>n</EM>,
and <EM>B</EM> be the matrix of the same size whose (<EM>i,j</EM>)
entry is (-1)<SUP><EM>i+j</EM></SUP> times the determinant of the
matrix obtained from <EM>A</EM> by deleting its (<EM>j,i</EM>)
[sic] entry.  (This <EM>B</EM> is often, and confusingly,
called the adjoint of <EM>A</EM>.  Blecch.  We'll call it
the cofactor matrix; see below.)  Then
<EM> A B = B A</EM> = det(<EM>A</EM>) times the identity
matrix.  Corollary: a square matrix with integer entries
has an integer inverse if and only if its determinant is 1
or -1.  (Likewise with <STRONG>Z</STRONG> replaced by any
commutative ring: the determinant must be a ``unit'', i.e. an
invertible element of the ring.)

<P>

The entries if <EM>B</EM> are called ``cofactors'' of <EM>A</EM>.
These are (up to a plus-or-minus sign) special cases of ``minors''
of a matrix.  A minor of a (not necessarily square) matrix <EM>A</EM>
is the determinant of a square matrix obtained by omitting some
rows and/or columns of <EM>A</EM>.
[A determinant of order 0 is deemed to equal 1, as in
0!=<EM>x</EM><SUP>0</SUP>=1.]  We have seen already that a square
matrix of order <EM>n</EM> has rank <<EM>n</EM> if and only if
its determinant vanishes.  This generalizes as follows: the rank
of any matrix <EM>A</EM> is the largest integer <EM>r</EM> such that
some order-<EM>r</EM> minor of <EM>A</EM> does not vanish.

<P>

Proof: It is clear that the rank is at least <EM>r</EM>, because
we have <EM>r</EM> linearly independent columns.  We'll show that,
conversely, if there are <EM>r</EM> linearly independent columns
then at least one of the minors formed with these columns is nonzero.
This is because the submatrix of <EM>A</EM> formed with these columns
has rank <EM>r</EM>; therefore, so does its transpose.  So, its
rows span <EM>F<SUP>r</SUP></EM>, and include a basis.  Using these
rows gives the desired minor.

<P>

Corollary: the rank of the cofactor matrix of <EM>A</EM> is
<EM>n</EM>,1,0 according as the rank of <EM>A</EM> is
<EM>n</EM>, <EM>n</EM>-1, or less than <EM>n</EM>-1.
