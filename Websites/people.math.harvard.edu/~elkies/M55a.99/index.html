at least in the beginning of the <STRONG>linear algebra</STRONG>
unit, we'll be following the Axler textbook closely enough that
supplementary lecture notes should not be needed.  Some important
extensions/modifications to the treatment in Axler:

<UL>
<LI> [cf. Axler, p.3]
Unless noted otherwise, <STRONG>F</STRONG> may be an arbitrary
field, not only <STRONG>R</STRONG> or <STRONG>C</STRONG>.  The
most important fields other than those of real and complex numbers
are the field <STRONG>Q</STRONG> of rational numbers, and the
finite fields <STRONG>Z</STRONG>/<EM>p</EM><STRONG>Z</STRONG>
(<EM>p</EM> prime).  Other examples are the field
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>(<EM>i</EM>) of complex numbers with rational
real and imaginary parts; more generally,
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>(<EM>d</EM><SUP>1/2</SUP>) for any nonsquare
rational number <EM>d</EM>; the ``<EM>p</EM>-adic numbers''
<STRONG>Q</STRONG><SUB><EM>p</EM></SUB> (<EM>p</EM> prime),
introduced at the end of our topology unit; and more exotic
finite fields such as the 9-element field
(<STRONG>Z</STRONG>/<EM>3</EM><STRONG>Z</STRONG>)(<EM>i</EM>).
Here's a <A HREF="field.html">review</A>
of the axioms for fields, vector spaces, and related mathematical
structures.

<LI> [cf. Axler, p.22] We define the span of an arbitrary subset
<EM>S</EM> of (or tuple in) a vector space <EM>V</EM> as follows:
it is the set of all (finite) linear combinations
<EM>a</EM><SUB>1</SUB> <EM>v</EM><SUB>1</SUB> + ... +
<EM>a<SUB>n</SUB> v<SUB>n</SUB></EM>
with each <EM>v<SUB>i</SUB></EM> in <EM>V</EM> and each
<EM>a<SUB>i</SUB></EM> in <EM>F</EM>.  This is still the smallest
vector subspace of <EM>V</EM> containing <EM>S</EM>.  In particular,
if <EM>S</EM> is empty, its span is by definition {0}.  We do
<EM>not</EM> require that <EM>S</EM> be finite.

<LI> Axler does not seem to explicitly use the important notion
of a <EM>quotient</EM> vector space.  If <EM>U</EM> is a subspace
of a vector space <EM>V</EM>, we get an equivalence relation
on <EM>V</EM> by defining two vectors <EM>v,v'</EM> to be equivalent
(``congruent mod <EM>U</EM>'') if <EM>v-v'</EM> is in <EM>U</EM>.
The set of equivalence classes then itself becomes a vector space
(this must be proved!), called the quotient space <EM>V/U</EM>.
[Note that this is also a notation for <EM>V</EM> being a vector
space over a field <EM>U</EM> -- we shall strive to make it clear
which meaning we intend when both meanings might make sense.]

<LI> Axler proves the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using
complex analysis, which cannot be assumed in Math 55.
<A HREF="fta.ps">Here</A>'s a proof using the topological
tools we developed in the first month of class.
(Axler gives the complex-analytic proof on page 67.)

<LI> Axler unaccountably soft-pedals the important notion of
<EM>duality</EM>; we devote much of the seventh problem set
to this, and return to it often later.

<LI> We shall need some ``eigenstuff'' also in an infinite-dimensional
setting, so will not assume that any vector space is (nonzero) finite
dimensional unless we really must.

<LI> Triangular matrices are intimately related with ``flags''.
A <EM>flag</EM> in a finite dimensional vector space <EM>V</EM>
is a sequence of subspaces {0}=<EM>V</EM><SUB>0</SUB>,
<EM>V</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>V</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ...,
<EM>V<SUB>n</SUB>=V</EM>, with each
<EM>V<SUB>i</SUB></EM> of dimension <EM>i</EM> and containing
<EM>V</EM><SUB><EM>i</EM>-1</SUB>.  A basis
<EM>v</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>v</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <EM>v<SUB>n</SUB></EM>
determines a flag: <EM>V<SUB>i</SUB></EM> is the span of the first
<EM>i</EM> basis vectors.  Another basis
<EM>w</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>w</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <EM>w<SUB>n</SUB></EM>
determines the same flag if and only if each
<EM>w<SUB>i</SUB></EM> is a linear combination of
<EM>v</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>v</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <EM>v<SUB>i</SUB></EM>
(necessarily with nonzero <EM>v<SUB>i</SUB></EM> coefficient).
The <EM>standard flag</EM> in <EM>F<SUB>n</SUB></EM> is the flag
obtained in this way from the standard basis of unit vectors
<EM>e</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>e</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <EM>e<SUB>n</SUB></EM>.
The punchline is that, just as a diagonal matrix is one that respects
the standard basis (equivalently, the associated decomposition of
<EM>V</EM> as a direct some of 1-dimensional subspaces),
<EM>an upper-triangular matrix is one that respects the standard flag.</EM>
Note that the <EM>i</EM>-th diagonal entry of a triangular matrix
gives the action on the one-dimensional quotient space
<EM>V<SUB>i</SUB></EM>/<EM>V</EM><SUB><EM>i</EM>-1</SUB>
(each <EM>i</EM>=1,...,<EM>n</EM>).

<LI> As explained in class, the generalization to arbitrary fields
<EM>F</EM> of Axler's treatment (pages 91-93) of invariant subspaces
on real vector spaces looks like this:<BR>
Suppose <EM>u</EM> is a nonzero vector in an <EM>F</EM>-vector space
<EM>V</EM>, and <EM>Q</EM> is an irreducible polynomial of degree
<EM>d</EM>>0 in <EM>F</EM>[<EM>X</EM>] such that <EM>(Q(T))u</EM>=0.
Then the <EM>d</EM> vectors <EM>u,Tu,T</EM><SUP>2</SUP><EM>u, ...,
T</EM><SUP><EM>d</EM>-1</SUP>u span a <EM>T</EM>-invariant subspace
<EM>U</EM> of <EM>V</EM>.  Our key claim was that these vectors
are in fact linearly independent, and thus that <EM>U</EM> is
<EM>d</EM>-dimensional.  Indeed, a purported linear relation
would take the form <EM>(R(T))u</EM>=0 for some polynomial
<EM>R</EM>, not identically zero, of degree strictly less than
<EM>d</EM>.  But then <EM>Q</EM> and <EM>R</EM> are relatively prime,
so there exist polynomials <EM>A,B</EM> such that <EM>AQ+BR</EM>=1.
Thus <EM>A(T)Q(T)+B(T)R(T)</EM> is the identity operator on <EM>V</EM>.
Evaluating at <EM>u</EM> yields 0=<EM>u</EM>, contradiction.

<P>

To put this <EM>AQ+BR</EM> trick in context: let <EM>I<SUB>u</SUB></EM>
be the set of polynomials <EM>P</EM> such that <EM>P(T)u=0</EM>.
Then <EM>I<SUB>u</SUB></EM> is an <STRONG>ideal</STRONG> in
<EM>F</EM>[<EM>X</EM>]: if <EM>P,P'</EM> are in <EM>I<SUB>u</SUB></EM>
then so is <EM>P+P'</EM>, as well as <EM>AP</EM> for <EM>any</EM>
polynomial <EM>A</EM>.  Now for any polynomial <EM>Q</EM>, the
set of all polynomials of the form <EM>AQ</EM> is an ideal, the
so-called ``principal ideal'' generated by <EM>Q</EM>.  Conversely,
<STRONG>every ideal in</STRONG> <EM>F</EM>[<EM>X</EM>]
<STRONG>is principal</STRONG>.  This is proved as it is for
ideals in <STRONG>Z</STRONG>, using the division algorithm
(Axler, 4.5 on page 66 ff.).  This means than if an ideal <EM>I</EM>
contains an <EM>irreducible</EM> polynomial <EM>Q</EM> --
and thus contains the principal ideal generated by <EM>Q</EM> --
then either <EM>I</EM> is that principal ideal, or it is all
of <EM>F</EM>[<EM>X</EM>].  Going back to our case
<EM>I</EM>=<EM>I<SUB>u</SUB></EM>, we find that in the first
case <EM>U</EM> has dimension <EM>d</EM>, and in the second
case <EM>I<SUB>u</SUB></EM> contains 1 so <EM>u</EM>=0.
[Alternatively, given <EM>Q</EM> and <EM>R</EM>,
the set of all polynomials of the form <EM>AQ+BR</EM>
is again an ideal, etc.]

<LI> A bilinear pairing on a vector space <EM>V</EM> is said
to be <STRONG>skew-symmetric</STRONG> (a.k.a. ``anti-symmetric''
or ``alternating'') if <<EM>x</EM>,<EM>x</EM>>=0 for all
<EM>x</EM> in <EM>V</EM>.  By expanding
<<EM>x</EM>+<EM>y</EM>, <EM>x</EM>+<EM>y</EM>>
we deduce that <<EM>x</EM>,<EM>y</EM>> = - <<EM>y</EM>,<EM>x</EM>>
for all <EM>x</EM>, <EM>y</EM> in <EM>V</EM>, whence the terminology.
Conversely the identity
<<EM>x</EM>,<EM>y</EM>> = - <<EM>y</EM>,<EM>x</EM>>
implies <<EM>x</EM>,<EM>x</EM>>=0 (let <EM>y</EM>=<EM>x</EM>),
except when the ground field <EM>F</EM> has characteristic 2,
in which case <<EM>x</EM>,<EM>y</EM>> = - <<EM>y</EM>,<EM>x</EM>>
amounts to the condition that the pairing be symmetric.

<LI> A <STRONG>norm</STRONG> on a real or complex vector space
<EM>V</EM> is any function <EM>v</EM> |--> |<EM>v</EM>| from
<EM>V</EM> to the real numbers such that:
<UL>
<LI> The identity |<EM>cv</EM>| = |<EM>c</EM>| |<EM>v</EM>|
holds for all scalars <EM>c</EM> and all vectors <EM>v</EM>;
<LI> <EM>d</EM>(<EM>x,y</EM>) := |<EM>x-y</EM>|
defines a distance function on <EM>V</EM>.
</UL>
The second condition means that: |<EM>v</EM>| is nonnegative
for all <EM>v</EM>, and zero iff <EM>v</EM>=0; and
|<EM>v</EM>+<EM>v'</EM>| <= |<EM>v</EM>| + |<EM>v'</EM>|
for all vectors <EM>v</EM>, <EM>v'</EM>.  (These correspond
to the nonnegativity and triangle inequality respectively;
what happened to symmetry?)  For instance, we have seen in
effect that |<EM>x</EM>| := max(|<EM>x</EM><SUB>1</SUB>|, ...,
|<EM>x</EM><SUB><EM>n</EM></SUB>|) defines a norm on
<STRONG>R</STRONG><SUP><EM>n</EM></SUP> or
<STRONG>C</STRONG><SUP><EM>n</EM></SUP>; on pages 102-105,
Axler in effect verifies that |<EM>x</EM>|<SUP>2</SUP> =
(<EM>x</EM>,<EM>x</EM>) gives a norm on an inner-product space.

<LI>
<A HREF="spectral.html">Here</A>'s an outline of the standard proof of
the Spectral Theorem for self-adjoint oprators on a finite-dimensional
<EM>real</EM> inner product space.

<LI> Here are basic definitions and constructions involving
<A HREF="group.html">groups</A> that give a more general context
for some of our results so far and will be especially useful in
our coming discussion of determinants.

<LI> Here are definitions and basic results concerning
<A HREF="minor.html">cofactors and minors</A> of a matrix.

<LI> And <A HREF="pfaff.html">here</A> are some symple results
and pfacts about symplectic spaces and the Pfaffian.

<A NAME="today">
<img src="http:/~elkies/orangeball.gif">
Here are some <A HREF="pp.ps">practice problems</A>
for the final exam, covering both topology and linear
algebra (sometimes both in the same problem).  These
are intentionally harder than I expect the final to be.

<P>

The following remarks concerning ``little <EM>o</EM> notation''
are relevant to the concepts of differentiability etc.; cf. the
first ``Remark'' in Rudin, p.213.  If <EM>f,g</EM> are functions
on the same metric space, the notation ``<EM>f=o(g)</EM> as
<EM>x</EM> approaches <EM>x</EM><SUB>0</SUB>'' means:
for every positive epsilon there is a neighborhood of
<EM>x</EM><SUB>0</SUB> on which |<EM>f(x)</EM>| <= epsilon <EM>g(x)</EM>.
Note that for this to make sense, <EM>g</EM> had better be a nonnegative
real function, and <EM>f</EM> must take values in a normed vector
space -- though equivalent norms yield the same meaning for
``<EM>f=o(g)</EM>''.  Thus: <EM>F</EM> has derivative <EM>F'(x)</EM>
at <EM>x</EM> if and only if
<EM>F(x+h)=F(x)+F'(x)h+o(</EM>|<EM>h</EM>|<EM>)</EM>
as <EM>h</EM> approaches 0.  (Here <EM>F</EM> is a vector-valued
function defined on some neighborhood of <EM>x</EM>.)
The advantage of this is that we don't have to fiddle
with the special case <EM>h</EM>=0.

<P>

Check that: if <EM>f=o(h)</EM> and <EM>g=o(h)</EM> then
<EM>f+g=o(h)</EM>; if <EM>f=o(h)</EM> and <EM>g</EM> is
a bounded scalar-valued function then
<EM>fg=o(h)</EM>; if <EM>f=o(g)</EM> and <EM>g=o(h)</EM> then
<EM>f=o(h)</EM>; if <EM>x</EM> is a function of <EM>y</EM>
continuous at <EM>y</EM><SUB>0</SUB>, and <EM>f=o(g)</EM>
as <EM>x</EM> approaches <EM>x(y</EM><SUB>0</SUB><EM>)</EM>,
then <EM>f=o(g)</EM> as <EM>y</EM> approaches <EM>y</EM><SUB>0</SUB>.
The chain rule for vector-valued functions (Rudin., p.214, Theorem 9.15)
then becomes clear.

<P>

[Incidentally, there's also a ``big <EM>O</EM>'' notation:
``<EM>f=O(g)</EM>'' means ``there exists a constant <EM>C</EM>
such that |<EM>f(x)</EM>| <= <EM>C g(x)</EM> for all <EM>x</EM>''.
Note that this is conceptually simpler since there is no choice
of epsilons.]
