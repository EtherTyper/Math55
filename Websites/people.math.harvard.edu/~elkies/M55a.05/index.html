Our first topic is the <em>topology of metric spaces</em>,
a fundamental tool of modern mathematics
that we shall use mainly as a key ingredient in our rigorous development
of differential and integral calculus.  To supplement the treatment
in Rudin's textbook, I wrote up 20-odd pages of notes in six sections;
copies will be distributed in class, and you also may view them
and print out copies in advance from the PostScript or PDF files
linked below.

Basic definitions and examples:
the metric spaces <STRONG>R</STRONG><SUP><EM>n</EM></SUP>
and other product spaces; isometries; boundedness and function spaces

<blockquote>
  <img src="purpball.gif">
  If <em>S</em> is an infinite set and
  <em>X</em> is an unbounded metric space then
  we can't use our definition of <em>X</em><sup><em>S</em></sup>
  as a metric space because
   sup<sub><em>S</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>d<sub>X</sub></em>(<em>f</em>(<em>s</em>),<em>g</em>(<em>s</em>))
  might be infinite.  But the <em>bounded functions</em> from <em>S</em>
  to <em>X</em> <u>do</u> constitute a metric space under the same
  definition of <em>d<sub>X<sup>S</sup></sub></em>.  A function
  is said to be ``bounded'' if its image is a bounded set.
  You should check that that
  <em>d<sub>X<sup>S</sup></sub></em>(<em>f</em>,<em>g</em>)
  is in fact finite for bounded <em>f</em> and <em>g</em>.

  The ``Proposition'' on page 3 of the first topology handout
  can be extended as follows:
  <blockquote>
   iv) For <strong>every</strong> point <em>p</em> of <em>X</em>
   there exists a real number <em>M</em> such that
   <em>d</em>(<em>p</em>,<em>q</em>)&lt;<em>M</em>

  In other words, for every <em>p</em> in <em>X</em>
  there exists an open ball about <em>p</em> that contains <em>E</em>.

at least in the beginning of the <STRONG>linear algebra</STRONG>
unit, we'll be following the Axler textbook closely enough that
supplementary lecture notes should not be needed.  Some important
extensions/modifications to the treatment in Axler:

<UL>
<LI> [cf. Axler, p.3]
Unless noted otherwise, <STRONG>F</STRONG> may be an arbitrary
field, not only <STRONG>R</STRONG> or <STRONG>C</STRONG>.  The
most important fields other than those of real and complex numbers
are the field <STRONG>Q</STRONG> of rational numbers, and the
finite fields <STRONG>Z</STRONG>/<EM>p</EM><STRONG>Z</STRONG>
(<EM>p</EM> prime).  Other examples are the field
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>(<EM>i</EM>) of complex numbers with rational
real and imaginary parts; more generally,
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>(<EM>d</EM><SUP>1/2</SUP>) for any nonsquare
rational number <EM>d</EM>; the ``<EM>p</EM>-adic numbers''
<STRONG>Q</STRONG><SUB><EM>p</EM></SUB> (<EM>p</EM> prime),
introduced at the end of our topology unit; and more exotic
finite fields such as the 9-element field
(<STRONG>Z</STRONG>/<EM>3</EM><STRONG>Z</STRONG>)(<EM>i</EM>).
Here's a <A HREF="field.html">review</A>
of the axioms for fields, vector spaces, and related mathematical
structures.

<LI> [cf. Axler, p.22] We define the span of an arbitrary subset
<EM>S</EM> of (or tuple in) a vector space <EM>V</EM> as follows:
it is the set of all (finite) linear combinations
<EM>a</EM><SUB>1</SUB> <EM>v</EM><SUB>1</SUB> + ... +
<EM>a<SUB>n</SUB> v<SUB>n</SUB></EM>
with each <EM>v<SUB>i</SUB></EM> in <EM>V</EM> and each
<EM>a<SUB>i</SUB></EM> in <EM>F</EM>.  This is still the smallest
vector subspace of <EM>V</EM> containing <EM>S</EM>.  In particular,
if <EM>S</EM> is empty, its span is by definition {0}.  We do
<EM>not</EM> require that <EM>S</EM> be finite.

<LI> About the infamous ``<A HREF="lemma3.pdf">Lemma 3.?</A>'':
some notes and warnings about the behavior of
Hom(<em>V</em>,<em>W</em>) under (finite or infinite) direct sums.

<!--
<LI> Unlike Axler, we spend some time on ``quotient vector spaces'',
described a bit more fully in the
<A HREF="qanda.html#quotient">Q & A</A> page.
-->
<LI> Unlike Axler, we spend some time on ``quotient vector spaces''.

<LI> Axler also unaccountably soft-pedals the important notion of
<A HREF="dual.html"><strong>duality</strong></A>.

<LI> Here's a brief preview of
<A HREF="nonsense.html">abstract nonsense</A> (a.k.a. diagram-chasing),
and a diagram-chasing interpretation of quotients and duality.

<LI> Axler proves the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using
complex analysis, which cannot be assumed in Math 55.
<A HREF="fta.ps">Here</A>'s a proof using the topological tools
we developed in the first month of class, in
<A HREF="fta.ps">PS</A> and <A HREF="fta.pdf">PDF</A>.
(Axler gives the complex-analytic proof on page 67.)

<LI> We shall need some ``eigenstuff'' also in an infinite-dimensional
setting, so will not assume that any vector space is (nonzero) finite
dimensional unless we really must.

<LI> If <em>T</em> is a linear operator on a vector space <em>V</em>,
and <em>U</em> is an invariant subspace, then the quotient space
<em>V</em>/<em>U</em> inherits an action of <em>T</em>.
Moreover, the annihilator of <em>U</em> in <em>V</em><sup>*</sup>
is an invariant subspace for the action of the adjoint operator
<em>T</em><sup>*</sup> on <em>V</em><sup>*</sup>.
(Make sure you understand why both these claims hold.)

<LI> Triangular matrices are intimately related with ``flags''.
A <EM>flag</EM> in a finite dimensional vector space <EM>V</EM>
is a sequence of subspaces {0}=<EM>V</EM><SUB>0</SUB>,
<EM>V</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>V</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ...,
<EM>V<SUB>n</SUB>=V</EM>, with each
<EM>V<SUB>i</SUB></EM> of dimension <EM>i</EM> and containing
<EM>V</EM><SUB><EM>i</EM>-1</SUB>.  A basis
<EM>v</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>v</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ...,
<EM>v<SUB>n</SUB></EM>
determines a flag: <EM>V<SUB>i</SUB></EM> is the span of the first
<EM>i</EM> basis vectors.  Another basis
<EM>w</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>w</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ...,
<EM>w<SUB>n</SUB></EM>
determines the same flag if and only if each
<EM>w<SUB>i</SUB></EM> is a linear combination of
<EM>v</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>v</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ...,
<EM>v<SUB>i</SUB></EM>
(necessarily with nonzero <EM>v<SUB>i</SUB></EM> coefficient).
The <EM>standard flag</EM> in <EM>F<SUB>n</SUB></EM> is the flag
obtained in this way from the standard basis of unit vectors
<EM>e</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>e</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ...,
<EM>e<SUB>n</SUB></EM>.
The punchline is that, just as a diagonal matrix is one that respects
the standard basis (equivalently, the associated decomposition of
<EM>V</EM> as a direct sum of 1-dimensional subspaces),
<EM>an upper-triangular matrix is one that respects the standard
flag.</EM>
Note that the <EM>i</EM>-th diagonal entry of a triangular matrix
gives the action on the one-dimensional quotient space
<EM>V<SUB>i</SUB></EM>/<EM>V</EM><SUB><EM>i</EM>-1</SUB>
(each <EM>i</EM>=1,...,<EM>n</EM>).
</ul>
<img src="redball.gif">
Less surprising than the absence of quotients and duality
in Axler is the lack of <strong>tensor algebra</strong>.
That won't stop us in Math&nbsp;55, though.  Here's an introduction in
<A HREF="tensor.ps">PS</A> and <A HREF="tensor.pdf">PDF</A>.
[As you might guess from \oplus,
the TeXism for the tensor-product symbol is \otimes.]
<ul>
<li> One of many applications is the <strong>trace</strong> of
an operator on a finite dimensional <em>F</em>-vector space <em>V</em>.
This is a linear map from Hom(<em>V</em>,<em>V</em>) to <em>F</em>.
We can define it simply as the composition of two maps:
our identification of Hom(<em>V</em>,<em>V</em>) with
the tensor product of <em>V</em><sup>*</sup> and <em>V</em>,
and the natural map from this tensor product to <em>F</em>
coming from the bilinear map taking (<em>v</em><sup>*</sup>,<em>v</em>)
to <em>v</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>v</em>).
<li> Here are some basic facts about general
<A HREF="norm.html"><strong>norms</strong></A>
on real and complex vector spaces.
<li> Just as we can study bilinear symmetric forms
on a vector space over any field, not just <strong>R</strong>,
we can study sesquilinear conjugate-symmetric forms
on a vector space over any field <em>with a conjugation</em>,
not just <strong>C</strong>.
Here a ``conjugation'' on a field <em>F</em> is a field automorphism
<nobr>sigma:<em>F</em>--&gt;<em>F</em></nobr>
such that sigma is not the identity
but sigma<sup>2</sup> is (that is, sigma is an involution).
Given a basis {<em>v</em><sub>i</sub>} for&nbsp;<em>F</em>,
a sesquilinear form &lt;.,.&gt; on&nbsp;<em>F</em>
is determined by the field elements
<em>a</em><sub>i,j</sub>=&lt;<em>v</em><sub>i</sub>,<em>v</em><sub>j</sub>&gt;,
and is conjugate-symmetric if and only if
<em>a</em><sub>j,i</sub>=sigma(<em>a</em><sub>i,j</sub>)
for all i,j.
Note that the ``diagonal entries'' <em>a</em><sub>i,i</sub>
--- and more generally &lt;<em>v</em>,<em>v</em>&gt;
for any <em>v</em> in&nbsp;<em>V</em> --- must be elements
of the subfield of <em>F</em> fixed by&nbsp;sigma.
<li> ``Sylvester's Law of Inertia'' states that
for a nondegenerate pairing on a finite-dimensional vector space
<em>V</em>/<em>F</em>, where either
<em>F</em>=<strong>R</strong> and the pairing is
bilinear and symmetric, or
<em>F</em>=<strong>C</strong> and the pairing is
sesquilinear and conjugate-symmetric,
<em>
the counts of positive and negative inner products
for an orthogonal basis constitute an invariant of the pairing
</em>
and do not depend on the choice of orthogonal basis.
(This invariant is known as the ``signature'' of the pairing.)
The key trick in proving this result is as follows.
Suppose <em>V</em> is the orthogonal direct sum of subspaces 
<em>U</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>U</em><sub>2</sub>
for which the pairing is positive definite on <em>U</em><sub>1</sub>
and negative definite on <em>U</em><sub>2</sub>.
Then any subspace <em>W</em> of <em>V</em>
on which the pairing is positive definite
has dimension no greater than dim(<em>U</em><sub>1</sub>).
Proof: On the intersection of <em>W</em> with <em>U</em><sub>2</sub>,
the pairing is both positive and negative definite;
hence that subspace is {0}.  The claim follows by a dimension count,
and we quickly deduce Sylvester's Law.
<li> Over any field not of characteristic 2,
we know that for any non-degenerate
symmetric pairing on a finite-dimensional vector space
there is an orthogonal basis, or equivalently
a choice of basis such that the pairing is
(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)=sum<sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>a<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;x<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;y<sub>i</sub></em>)
for some nonzero scalars <em>a<sub>i</sub></em>.
But in general it can be quite hard to decide whether
two different collections of <em>a<sub>i</sub></em>
yield isomorphic pairings.  Even over <strong>Q</strong>
the answer is already tricky in dimensions 2 and 3,
and I don't think it's known in a vector space of arbitrary dimension.
<!--
<li> Here's an online version of the notes for the
lecture on <A HREF="lattice.html">lattices</A>.
-->
<li> Re Chapter 7: we'll prove the Spectral Theorem
for a self-adjoint or Hermitian operator <em>T</em>
on a finite-dimensional real or complex vector space,
not a la Axler, but by the usual method of maximizing
the ``Rayleigh quotient'' <nobr>&lt;Tv,v&gt;/&lt;v,v&gt;</nobr>.
Likewise for normal operators
on a finite dimensional <strong>C</strong>-vector space,
by maximizing <nobr>&lt;Tv,Tv&gt;/&lt;v,v&gt;</nobr>.
<li> All of Chapter 8 works over an arbitrary algebraically closed field,
not only over <strong>C</strong>
(except for the minor point about extracting square roots,
which breaks down in characteristic&nbsp;2); and
the first section (``Generalized Eigenvalues'') works over any field.
<li> We don't stop at Corollary 8.8: let <em>T</em> be any operator
on a vector space <em>V</em> over a field <em>F</em>, not assumed
algebraically closed.  If <em>V</em> is finite-dimensional, then
The Following Are Equivalent:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(1) There exists a nonnegative integer <em>k</em>
such that <em>T<sup>k</sup></em>=0;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(2) For any vector <em>v</em>, there exists a nonnegative integer
<em>k</em> such that <em>T<sup>k</sup>v</em>=0;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(3) <em>T<sup>n</sup></em>=0, where <em>n</em>=dim(<em>V</em>).
<br>
Note that (1) and (2) make no mention of the dimension,
but are still not equivalent for operators on infinite-dimensional spaces.
We readily deduce the further equivalent conditions:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(4) There exists a basis for <em>V</em> for which
<em>T</em> has an upper-triangular matrix
with every diagonal entry equal zero;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(5) Every upper-triangular matrix for <em>T</em>
has zeros on the diagonal,
and there exists at least one upper-triangular matrix for <em>T</em>.
<br>
Recall that the second part of (5) is automatic
if <em>F</em> is algebraically closed.
<li> The space of generalized 0-eigenvectors
(the maximal subspace on which <em>T</em> is nilpotent)
is sometimes called the <em>nilspace</em> of <em>T</em>.
It is an invariant subspace.  When <em>V</em> is finite dimensional,
<em>V</em> is the direct sum of the nilspace and another invariant
subspace <em>V'</em>, consisting of the intersection of the subspaces
<em>T<sup>k</sup></em>(<em>V</em>) as <em>k</em> ranges over all
positive integers.  See Exercise&nbsp;8.11;
This can be used to quickly prove Theorem 8.23
and consequences such as Cayley-Hamilton (Theorem 8.20).
<li> The dimension of the space of generalized <em>c</em>-eigenvalues
(i.e., of the nilspace of <em>T-cI</em>) is usually called the
<em>algebraic</em> multiplicity of <em>c</em>
(since it's the multiplicity of <em>c</em>
as a root of the characteristic polynomial of <em>T</em>),
to distinguish it from the ``geometric multiplicity''
which is the dimension of ker(<em>T-cI</em>).
</ul>
<A NAME="today">
<img src="orangeball.gif">
We'll <em>define</em> the determinant of an operator <em>T</em>
on a finite dimensional space <em>V</em> as follows:
<em>T</em> induces a linear operator <em>T</em>'
on the top exterior power of <em>V</em>;
this exterior power is one-dimensional,
so an operator on it is multiplication by some scalar;
det(<em>T</em>) is by definition the scalar
corresponding to <em>T</em>'.
The ``top exterior power'' is a subspace of the ``exterior algebra''
of <em>V</em>, which is the quotient of the tensor algebra by
the ideal generated by {<em>v</em>*<em>v</em>: <em>v</em> in <em>V</em>}.
We'll still have to construct the sign homomorphism from the
symmetry group of order dim(<em>V</em>) to {1,-1}
to make sure that this exterior algebra is as large
as we expect it to be, and that in particular that
the (dim(<em>V</em>))-th exterior power has dimension 1
rather than zero.
<p>
Some more tidbits about exterior algebra:
<ul>
<li>If <em>w</em>, <em>w</em>' are elements of the
 <em>m</em>-th and <em>m</em>'-th exterior powers of <em>V</em>,
 then <em>ww</em>'=(-1)<sup><em>mm</em>'</sup><em>w</em>'<em>w</em>;
 that is, <em>w</em> and <em>w</em>' commute
 unless <em>m</em> and <em>m</em>' are both odd
 in which case they anticommute.
<li>If <em>m</em>+<em>m</em>'=<em>n</em>=dim(<em>V</em>)
 then the natural pairing from the
 <em>m</em>-th and <em>m</em>'-th exterior powers
 to the <em>n</em>-th is nondegenerate,
 and so identifies the <em>m</em>'-th exterior power canonically
 with the dual of the <em>m</em>-th
 <em>tensored with the top (n-th) exterior power</em>.
<li> In particular, if <em>m</em>=1,
 and <em>T</em> is any invertible operator on <em>V</em>,
 then we find that the induced action of <em>T</em>
 on the (<em>n</em>-1)st exterior power
 is the same as its action on <em>V</em><sup>*</sup>
 multiplied by det(<em>T</em>).
 This yields the formula connecting the inverse and cofactor matrix
 of an invertible matrix (a formula which you may also know
 in the guise of ``Cramer's rule'').
 <!--
 One consequence of this formula is that
 an <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> integer matrix <em>A</em>
 had an inverse with integer entries if and only if
 |det(<em>A</em>)|=1.  This in turn implies that
 |det(<em>M</em>)| is an invariant of the lattice
 <em>L</em>=<em>M</em><strong>Z</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup>.
 In 55b we'll interpret this invariant as
 the ``covolume'' of <em>L</em>, that is,
 the volume of the <em>n</em>-dimensional torus
 <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup>/<em>L</em>.
 -->
<li> For each <em>m</em> there is a natural non-degenerate pairing
 between the <em>m</em>-th exterior powers of
 <em>V</em> and <em>V</em><sup>*</sup>,
 which identifies these exterior powers with each other's dual.
</ul>
We'll also show that a symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix
is positive definite <u>iff</u> all its eigenvalues are positive
<u>iff</u> it has positive principal minors
(the ``principal minors'' are the determinants
of the square submatrices of all orders containing the (1,1) entry).
More generally we'll show that the eigenvalue signs determine
the signature, as does the sequence of signs of principal minors.
For positive definiteness, we have the two further
equivalent conditions: the symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix
<em>A</em>=(<em>a<sub>ij</sub></em>) is positive definite
<u>iff</u> there is a basis (<em>v<sub>i</sub></em>)
of <strong>F</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup> such that
<em>a<sub>ij</sub></em>=&lt;<em>v<sub>i</sub></em>,<em>v<sub>j</sub></em>&gt;
for all <em>i</em>,<em>j</em>, and
<u>iff</u> there is an invertible matrix <em>B</em> such that
<em>A</em>=<em>BB</em><sup>*</sup>.
For example, the matrix with entries 1/(<em>i</em>+<em>j</em>-1)
(``Hilbert matrix'') is positive-definite, because it is
the matrix of inner products (integrals on [0,1]) of the basis
1,<em>x</em>,<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>,...,<em>x</em><sup><em>n</em>-1</sup>
for the polynomials of degree &lt;<em>n</em>.
Can you find the determinant of this matrix?

More will be said about exterior algebra when differential forms

  For Problem 2: there exist <em>S</em>,<em>T</em>

  to <em>k</em> times the <nobr>(<em>k</em>-1)-st</nobr>
  (<em>k</em>=0,1,2,...,<em>n</em>-1),
  and let <em>T</em> take the <nobr><em>k</em>-th</nobr> basis vector
  to the <nobr>(<em>k</em>+1)-st</nobr>
  (with vectors number -1 and <em>n</em> being zero).
  This construction overcomes the absence of an
  <nobr><em>n</em>-th</nobr> basis vector
  because the image of this vector under <em>S</em>
  would vanish in any case
  when <em>n</em> is a multiple of the charcteristic!

(<em>v<sub>i</sub></em>, not ||<em>v<sub>i</sub></em>||, in 6(i);
typo in 7 -- thanks to Scott K. for both;
<br>
also in 7, a sentence to say explicitly
that <em>k</em> is fixed throughout;
<br>
and in the introductory paragraph for 8, the pairing
is on <em>V</em><sup>*</sup>, not <em>V</em>,
and the map is from <em>V</em><sup>*</sup> to <em>V</em>,
not <em>V</em> to <em>V</em><sup>*</sup>);
<br>
and (16.xii.05) again in 8, the ``associated pairing'' is now specified.

  In problem 2, an example of a proper closed subspace <em>W</em>
  with <em>W</em><sup>\perp</sup>={0} is the space of functions
  whose integral from 0 to 1/2 vanishes.
  This <em>W</em> is closed because the functional
  taking <em>f</em> to the integral of <em>f</em> over [0,1/2]
  is continuous (with delta=sqrt(2)*epsilon).
  In the completion of <em>V</em>, this subspace
  is the orthogonal complement of the 1-dimensional space
  generated by the characteristic function of the interval [0,1/2];
  but this characteristic function is not in <em>V</em> itself.
