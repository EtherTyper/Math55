The field axioms listed below describe the basic properties of
the four operations of arithmetic: ambition, distraction,
uglification, and derision.  [Don&rsquo;t blame me for this last;
it&rsquo;s due to C.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Dodgson, a.k.a. Lewis Carroll.  Go
<A HREF="http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/wonderland/turtle.htm"
 target="_blank">here</A>
for the relevant quote from <em>Alice</em>.]  Actually,
only ambition and uglification &mdash; er, addition and multiplication
&mdash; are needed, together with additive and multiplicative inverses
(which let us define $-,/$ in terms of $+,\times$) and identities.

A <em>field</em>, then, is a set $F$ equipped with:

<UL>
<LI> Two distinguished elements called $0$ and $1\!$, which must be different
<LI> A function from $F$ to $F$ called
 <em>additive inverse</em> and denoted by the unary minus sign
 (so the additive inverse of $a$ is $-a$), and
 a function from $F - \{0\}$ to $F - \{0\}$
 called <em>multiplicative inverse</em> that takes $a$ to
 an element called $a^{-1}$
 (we shall usually write $F^*$ for $F - \{0\}$)
<LI> Two functions from $F^2$ to $F$ called
 <em>addition</em> and <em>multiplication</em>; as usual we shall
 denote the images of $(a,b)$ under these two functions by
 $a+b$ and $a \times b$ (or $a \cdot b$, or simply $ab$).
</UL>

These must satisfy the following nine conditions, or axioms:

<p>

i) For all $a$ in $F\!$, we have $a+0=0+a=a$
[i.e., $0$ is an additive identity]
<br>

ii) For all $a$ in $F\!$, we have $a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$
[this is what &ldquo;additive inverse&rdquo; means]
<br>

iii) For all $a,b,c$ in $F\!$, we have $a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c$
[i.e., addition is associative]

<blockquote>
 Conditions (i), (ii), (iii) assert that $(F,0,-,+)$ is a <em>group</em>.
 Familiar consequences are the right and left <em>cancellation rules</em>:
 if, for any $a,b,c$ in $F\!$, we have $a+c=b+c$ or $c+a=b+a$, then $a=b$.
 This is proved by adding $(-c)$ to both sides from the right
 or left respectively.  In particular, $a+a=a$ if and only if $a=0$.
 Likewise, for any $a,b$ in $F\!$, the equation $a+x=b$ has the unique
 solution $a = b+(-a)$, usually abbreviated $x = b - a$
 (do not confuse this binary operation of &ldquo;subtraction&rdquo;
 with the unary additive inverse!).
 Another standard consequence of (iii) is that,
 for any $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ in $F\!$, the sum
 $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$ is the same no matter how it is parenthesized.
 (In how many ways <em>can</em> that expression be parenthesized?)
</blockquote>

iv) For all $a,b$ in $F\!$, we have $a+b = b+a$
[i.e., addition is commutative]

<blockquote>
 Conditions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) assert that $(F,0,-,+)$
 is a <em>commutative group</em>, a.k.a. 
 <em>abelian group</em> or <em>additive group</em>.
 The first alias is a tribute to N.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Abel (1802&ndash;1829);
 the second reflects the fact that in general one only uses &ldquo;+&rdquo;
 for a group law when the group is commutative &mdash; else multiplicative
 notation is almost always used.
</blockquote>

v) For all $a$ in $F\!$, we have $a \times 1 = 1 \times a = a$
[i.e., $1$ is a multiplicative identity]
<br>

vi) For all $a$ in $F\!$, we have $a \times a^{-1} = a^{-1} \times a = 1$
[this is what &ldquo;multiplicative inverse&rdquo; means]
<br>

vii) For all $a,b,c$ in $F\!$, we have $a(bc)=(ab)c$
[i.e., multiplication is associative]

<blockquote>
 In particular, restricting (v), (vi) and (vii) to $F^*\!$,
 we are asserting that $(F^*, 1, {}^{-1}, \times)$ is a group.
 You probably know already that &ldquo;$a^{-1}$&rdquo; is
 a special case of the notation $a^n$ for any integer $n$, with
 $a^1 = a$ and $a^{m+n} = a^m a^n$ for all integers $m,n$
 (which implies $a^0 = 1$ in at least two ways); that is,
 in any group&nbsp;$G$, if we fix a group element $a$ then the map
 $m \mapsto a^m$ gives a <i>group homomorphism</i> from
 $({\bf Z}, +)$ to&nbsp;$G$.
</blockquote>

viii) For all $a,b$ in $F\!$, we have $ab=ba$
[i.e., multiplication is commutative]

<blockquote>
 So, the group $(F^*, 1, {}^{-1}, \times)$ is also abelian.
 For $a,b \in F$ with $a \neq 0$, the unique solution $a^{-1}\!b$ of $ax=b$
 is usually written $b/a$ <nobr>(or $\frac b a$);</nobr>
 in particular $a^{-1}$ is also $1/a$.
 Do not use the notation $b/a$ in a non-commutative group,
 because of the ambiguity between $a^{-1}\!b$ and $ba^{-1}$.
</blockquote>

ix) For all $a,b,c$ in $F\!$, we have $a(b+c)=(ab)+(ac)$ and $(a+b)c=(ac)+(bc)$.
[distributive law.  The second part is of course redundant by commutativity;
it is required in the &ldquo;skew&rdquo; case (see below).]

<p>

From (ix) together with the additive properties follows the basic identity:

<blockquote>
For all $a$ in $F\!$, we have $a \times 0 = 0 \times a = 0$.
</blockquote>

<em>Proof</em>: apply the distributive law to $a(0+0)$ and $(0+0)a$,
and use the fact that $0$ is the only solution of $x+x=x$.

<p>

Thus also:

<blockquote>
For all $a,b$ in $F\!$, we have $ab=0$ if and only if $a=0$ or $b=0$ (or both).
</blockquote>

<em>Proof</em>:
If $a$ is nonzero, multiply $ab=0$ by $a^{-1}$ to conclude $b=0$.

<p>

That is, a field has no (nontrivial) zero divisors.

<p>

If $F$ satisfies all the field axioms
except (viii), it is called a <em>skew field</em>;
the most famous example is the <em>quaternions</em> of
W.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Hamilton (1805&ndash;1865).  Much of linear algebra can
still be done over skew fields, but we shall not pursue this
much, if at all, in Math&nbsp;55.

<p>

Note that (vi) is the only axiom using the multiplicative inverse.
If we drop the existence of multiplicative inverses and axiom&nbsp;(vi),
<em>as well as the condition</em>&nbsp;$0\neq1$,
we obtain the structure of a commutative <em>ring</em> with unity.
For example, $\bf Z$ is such a ring which is not a field.
A ring may have nontrivial zero divisors (we shall see an example
of this in class); if it does not, it is called a <em>domain</em>.

<p>

If we also drop axiom (viii) from the ring axioms, we have a
ring with unity which need not be commutative.  An example is
the set of the Hamilton quaternions $a+bi+cj+dk$
whose coefficients $a,b,c,d$ are all integers.
Curiously if we allow the coefficients to be either all integers
or all <nobr>integers-plus-&frac12;</nobr> then we still get a ring,
called the ring of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz_quaternion">Hurwitz
quaternions</a>.

<p>

If $F$ is a ring that need not be a field, the notation
$F^*$ means <b>not</b> $F-\{0\}$ but the set of
(multiplicatively) invertible elements of&nbsp;$F\!$.
So if $F$ <em>is</em> a field the two notations coincide.
Whether or not $F$ is a field, $F^*$ is called the
<em>multiplicative group</em> of&nbsp;$F\!$.
(One sometimes also sees the equivalent term &ldquo;unit group&rdquo;,
because the invertible elements of a ring are called its &ldquo;units&rdquo;.)
You should verify that it is indeed a group.  For example,
the multiplicative group in the ring of Hamilton quaternions with
integer coefficients consists of the 8 elements $\pm 1,\pm i, \pm j, \pm k$;
it is known as the &ldquo;quaternion group&rdquo;.
How large is the unit group of the Hurwitz quaternions?


<HR>

A <em>vector space</em> over a field $F$ is an additive
group $V$ (the &ldquo;vectors&rdquo;)
together with a function (&ldquo;scalar multiplication&rdquo;)
taking a field element (&ldquo;scalar&rdquo;) and a vector to a vector,
as long as this function satisfies the axioms

<UL>
<LI> $1*v = v$ for all $v$ in $V$ [so $1$ remains a multiplicative identity],
<LI> for all scalars $a,b$ and all vectors $u,v$ we have
$a(u+v)=au+av$ and $(a+b)u=au+bu$ [distributive properties],
<LI> for all scalars $a,b$ and all vectors $v$ we have $a(bv)=(ab)v$
[associative property].
</UL>

[If $F$ is a skew field, there are two kinds of vector spaces,
depending on whether scalar multiplication is
&ldquo;from the left&rdquo; or &ldquo;from the right&rdquo;;
the distinction affects the associative law: does multiplying a vector
first by $b$ and then by $a$ amount to multiplying by $ab$ or $ba$?
The former would be indicated by multiplying from the left;
the latter, from the right.  Even if you don&rsquo;t much care about
linear algebra over skew fields, you&rsquo;ll encounter this issue soon
when we compose linear transformations and other functions.]

<p>

Notice that these axioms do not use the multiplicative inverse;
they can thus be used equally when $F$ is any ring
(even a non-commutative ring), in which case
the resulting structure is called a <em>module</em> over&nbsp;$F\!$.
But multiplicative inverses are used to prove most of the basic theorems
on vector spaces, so those theorems do not hold in the more general setting
of modules; for instance one cannot speak of the dimension of a general
module, even <nobr>over $\bf Z$</nobr>.
