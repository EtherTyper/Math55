<font size="+1">More about algebraically closed fields</font>
</strong>

<p>


Here is some further context for the notion of an algebraically closed field,
connecting it with irreducible polynomials and finite-degree field extensions.

<p>

The first of these is probably familiar at least in the case of
polynomials over&nbsp;<b>Q</b>.
A polynomial $P \in F[T]$ is said to be <em>irreducible</em>
(over the <nobr>field $F$</nobr>) if $P$ has positive degree
and any factorization $P = P_1 P_2$ with $P_1,P_2\in F[T]$
has either $P_1 \in F^*$ or $P_2 \in F^*$ &mdash; that is, $P_1$ or $P_2$
is in the group of units (invertible elements) of $F[T]$.
Irreducible polynomials are analogous to prime integers;
in particular, note that the positive-degree condition means that
the units themselves are not considered &ldquo;irreducible&rdquo;,
which is a useful convention for the same reason that we do not regard
$\pm 1$ as prime numbers.

<p>

As with primes, irreducible polynomials are characterized
by the property that for $M,N \in F[T]$ the product $MN$ is a multiple
<nobr>of $P$</nobr> <u>iff</u> either $M$ or $N$ is a multiple
<nobr>of $P$</nobr>.  One direction is clear: if $P$ is reducible
then the factorization $P = P_1 P_2$ (with neither $P_1$ nor $P_2$
a multiple <nobr>of $P$</nobr>) yields the counterexample $(M,N) = (P_1,P_2)$.
The other direction follows from division with remainder.
Again you&rsquo;ve probably seen the corresponding argument
over the integers, phrased either in terms of the Euclidean algorithm
or the fact that <b>Z</b> is a principal-ideal domain.
We take the latter route here.  If $I \subseteq F[T]$ is an ideal
other than $\{0\}$ then it contains a nonzero polynomial $A$ of minimal degree.
Then $I$ contains all multiples of $A$, and we claim that this is
all <nobr>of $I$</nobr>.  Indeed, any polynomial $Z \in I$ can be written as
$AQ+R$ for some $Q,R \in F[T]$ with $\deg R &lt; \deg A$, and then $I$ contains
$Z-AQ = R$, so $R=0$ and $Z=AQ$.  Now if $P$ is irreducible, and $M \in F[T]$
is not a multiple <nobr>of $P$</nobr>, then the ideal
$I = \{ MX + PY : X,Y \in F[T] \}$ (i.e. the ideal generated by $M,P$)
contains $P$, and is principal, so $I$ has some generator $A$ of which
$M,P$ are both multiples; but $P$ is irreducible, so $A$ is constant,
and $I$ is all of $F[T]$.  In particular, $1 = MX+PY$ for some $X,Y \in F[T]$.
But then $N = N(MX+PY) = (NM)X + PY$ is a multiple of $P$, as claimed.
(We could also obtain $1 = MX+PY$ using the Euclidean algorithm.
The conclusion that $P|N$ also follows from unique factorization in $F[T]$,
but unique factorization must in turn be proved using either the
Euclidean algorithm or the principal-ideal argument.)

<p>

What has all this to do with algebraic closure?
Well, a polynomial of degree $1$ is automatically irreducible,
because in a factorization one or the other factor must have degree&nbsp;zero.
<br>
Claim: <em>$F$ is algebraically closed if and only if
every irreducible polynomial in $F[T]$ has degree&nbsp;$1.$</em>
<br>
Proof: $\Rightarrow$ If $F$ is algebraically closed then any $P \in F[T]$
has a <nobr>degree-1</nobr> factor $T-t_1$; if $P$ is irreducible then
the complementary factor must have degree zero, so $\deg P = 1$.
<br>
$\Leftarrow$ By induction over $\deg A$, every nonconstant polynomial
$A \in F[T]$ has a factorization $A = \prod_{i=1}^m P_i$ where
$m>0$ and each $P_i$ is irreducible.  Writing each $P_i$ as $a_i (t-t_i)$
gives $A = a \prod_{i=1}^m (t-t_i)$ with $a = \prod_{i=1}^m a_i$.
So indeed $A$ factors completely.

<p>

A <em>field extension</em> of a field $F$ is some other $F'$
that contains $F$ (with the same field operations, so in particular
$0_F = 0_{F'}$ and $1_F = 1_{F'}).$  We observed already that
$F'$ is then a vector space <nobr>over $F$</nobr>.  The extension $F'/F$
is said to be <em>finite</em> if $F'$ is finite-dimensional as a
vector space <nobr>over~$F$</nobr>, in which case $\dim_F F'$
is called the <em>degree</em> of the extension and also denoted by $[F':F]$.
The familiar example is $F=\bf R$, $F'=\bf C$, with $[{\bf C} : {\bf R}] = 2$.
This is connected with irreducible polynomials as follows (which also
explains the &ldquo;degree&rdquo; terminology): if $P \in F[T]$ is
irreducible then $F' := F[T] \big/ P F[T]$ is a field extension of degree
equal to $\deg P$.  (This generalizes the familiar construction of $\bf C$
as ${\bf R}[i]$ modulo the relation $i^2 + 1 = 0$; here we in effect
set $P(T) = 0$.)  We already know that $\dim_F^{\phantom0} F' = \deg P$,
and the main thing to check is that when $P$ is irreducible $F'$ is
not just a commutative <nobr>$F$-algebra</nobr> (i.e., a ring containing a
copy <nobr>of $F$</nobr>, and thus constituting an <nobr>$F$-vector</nobr> space)
but even a field.  That is, if $M \in F[T]$ is not a multiple
<nobr>of $P$</nobr> then it is invertible $\bmod P$: there exists
$N \in F[T]$ such that $MN \equiv 1 \bmod P$.  The key is to observe
that the map $X \mapsto MX$ from $F'$ to $F'$ is an <nobr>$F$-linear</nobr>
transformation from a finite-dimensional vector space to itself,
and is thus surjective <u>iff</u> it is injective.  [This replaces
the familiar argument modulo a prime $p$, where we use the fact that
a map from the <em>finite</em> set ${\bf Z}/p{\bf Z}$ is surjective
<u>iff</u> it is injective.]  But injectivity of $X \mapsto MX$
comes down to what we showed above: if $N \bmod P$ is in the kernel
then $MN \equiv 0 \bmod P$, and since $M$ is not a multiple
<nobr>of $P$</nobr> we deduce that $N \equiv 0 \bmod P$ and thus
represents the zero element <nobr>of $F'$</nobr>.

<p>

In particular, if $F$ is <em>not</em> algebraically closed then
it has a finite extension of degree $\gt 1$.  Remarkably the converse
is true: if $F$ <em>is</em> algebraically closed then it has
no finite extensions other than $F$ itself.  (This is thus
our fourth equivalent characterization of algebraically closed fields.)
Indeed if $F'/F$ is a finite extension, say of <nobr>degree $d$</nobr>,
then for every $x \in F'$ the $d+1$ field elements $1,x,x^2,\ldots,x^d$
have a linear dependence <nobr>over $F$</nobr>, so $P(x) = 0$
for some polynomial $P \in F[T]$ which has degree <nobr>at most $d$</nobr>
and is not identically zero.  Clearly $P$ is not constant, so
we can write $P(x) = a \prod_{i=1}^m (x-t_i)$ for some positive $m \leq d$
and some $t_i \in F$ and $a \in F^*$.  Since $F'$ is a field, one of those
$m+1$ factors must vanish, and in cannot <nobr>be $a$</nobr>.  Therefore
$x-a_i = 0$ for <nobr>some $i$</nobr>, whence $x = a_i \in F$.
This proves that $F' = F$, <b>QED</b>.
