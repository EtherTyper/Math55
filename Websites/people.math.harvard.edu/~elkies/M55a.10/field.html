About the field and vector space axioms
</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ccffff">

The field axioms listed below describe the basic properties of
the four operations of arithmetic: ambition, distraction,
uglification, and derision.  [Don't blame me for this last;
it's due to C.L.Dodgson, a.k.a. Lewis Carroll.  Go
<A HREF="http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/wonderland/turtle.htm"
 target="_blank">here</A>
for the relevant quote from <em>Alice</em>.]  Actually,
only ambition and uglification &mdash; er, addition and multiplication
&mdash; are needed, together with additive and multiplicative inverses
and identities.

A <em>field</em>, then, is a set <em>F</em> equipped with:

<UL>
<LI> Two distinguished elements called 0 and 1, which must be different
<LI> A function from <em>F</em> to <em>F</em> called
 <em>additive inverse</em> and denoted by the unary minus sign
 (so the additive inverse of <em>a</em> is <em>-a</em>), and
 a function from <em>F</em>-{0} to <em>F</em>-{0}
 called <em>multiplicative inverse</em> that takes <em>a</em>
 to an element called <em>a</em><sup>-1</sup> (we shall usually
 write <em>F<sup>*</sup></em> for <em>F</em>-{0})
<LI> Two functions <em>F</em><sup>2</sup> to <em>F</em> called
 <em>addition</em> and <em>multiplication</em>; as usual we shall
 denote the images of (<em>a,b</em>) under these two functions by
 <em>a + b</em> and <em>a*b</em>
 (or <em>a&middot;b</em>, or simply <em>ab</em>).
</UL>

These must satisfy the following nine conditions, or axioms:

<p>

i) For all <em>a</em> in <em>F</em>, <em>a</em>+0=0+<em>a=a</em>
[i.e., 0 is an additive identity]
<br>

ii) For all <em>a</em> in <em>F</em>,
<em>a</em>+(-<em>a</em>)=(-<em>a</em>)+<em>a</em>=0
[this is what &ldquo;additive inverse&rdquo; means]
<br>

iii) For all <em>a,b,c</em> in <em>F</em>, <em>a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c</em>
[i.e., addition is associative]

<blockquote>
 Conditions (i), (ii), (iii) assert that (<em>F</em>,0,-,+) is
 a <em>group</em>.  Familiar consequences are the right and left
 <em>cancellation rules</em>: if, for any <em>a,b,c</em> in <em>F</em>,
 we have <em>a+c=b+c</em> or <em>c+a=b+a</em>, then <em>a=b</em>.
 This is proved by adding (<em>-c</em>) to both sides from the right
 or left respectively.  In particular, <em>a+a=a</em> if and only if
 <em>a</em>=0.  Likewise, for any <em>a,b</em> in <em>F</em>,
 the equation <em>a+x=b</em> has the unique solution
 <em>x=b+(-a)</em>, usually abbreviated <em>x=b-a</em>
 (do not confuse this binary operation of &ldquo;subtraction&rdquo;
 with the unary additive inverse!).
 Another standard consequence of (iii) is that,
 for any <em>a</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>a</em><sub>2</sub>, ... ,
 <em>a<sub>n</sub></em> in <em>F</em>, the sum
 <em>a</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>a</em><sub>2</sub> + ... + <em>a<sub>n</sub></em>
 is the same no matter how it is parenthesized.  (In how many ways
 <em>can</em> that expression be parenthesized?)
</blockquote>

iv) For all <em>a,b</em> in <em>F</em>, <em>a+b=b+a</em>
[i.e., addition is commutative]

<blockquote>
 Conditions (i), (ii), (iii) assert that (<em>F</em>,0,-,+) is
 a <em>commutative group</em>, a.k.a. 
 <em>abelian group</em> or <em>additive group</em>.
 The first alias is a tribute to N.H.Abel (1802-1829);
 the second reflects the fact that in general one only uses &ldquo;+&rdquo;
 for a group law when the group is commutative &mdash; else multiplicative
 notation is almost always used.
</blockquote>

v) For all <em>a</em> in <em>F</em>, <em>a</em>*1=1*<em>a=a</em>
[i.e., 1 is a multiplicative identity]
<br>

vi) For all <em>a</em> in <em>F</em><sup>*</sup>,
<em>a</em>*<em>a</em><sup>-1</sup>=<em>a</em><sup>-1</sup>*<em>a</em>=1
[this is what &ldquo;multiplicative inverse&rdquo; means]
<br>

vii) For all <em>a,b,c</em> in <em>F</em>, <em>a(bc)=(ab)c</em>
[i.e., multiplication is associative]

<blockquote>
 In particular, restricting (v), (vi) and (vii) to
 <em>F<sup>*</sup></em>, we are asserting that 
 (<em>F<sup>*</sup></em>,1,<sup>-1</sup>,*) is a group.
</blockquote>

viii) For all <em>a,b</em> in <em>F</em>, <em>ab=ba</em>
[i.e., multiplication is commutative]

<blockquote>
 So, the group (<em>F<sup>*</sup></em>,1,<sup>-1</sup>,*)
 is also abelian.
</blockquote>

ix) For all <em>a,b,c</em> in <em>F</em>,
<em>a(b+c)=(ab)+(ac)</em> and <em>(a+b)c=(ac)+(bc)</em>.
[distributive law.  The second part is of course redundant
by commutativity; it is required in the skew case.]

<p>

From (ix) together with the additive properties follows the
basic identity:

<blockquote>
For all <em>a</em> in <em>F</em>, <em>a</em>*0=0*<em>a</em>=0.
</blockquote>

<em>Proof</em>: apply the distributive law to <em>a</em>(0+0) and
(0+0)<em>a</em>, and use the fact that 0 is the only solution of
<em>x+x=x</em>.

<p>

Thus also:

<blockquote>
For all <em>a,b</em> in <em>F</em>, <em>ab</em>=0 if and only if
<em>a</em>=0 or <em>b</em>=0 (or both).
</blockquote>

<em>Proof</em>: If <em>a</em> is nonzero, multiply <em>ab</em>=0
by <em>a</em><sup>-1</sup> to conclude <em>b</em>=0.

<p>

That is, a field has no (nontrivial) zero divisors.

<p>

If <em>F</em> satisfies all the field axioms
except (viii), it is called a <em>skew field</em>;
the most famous example is the <em>quaternions</em> of
W.R.Hamilton (1805-1865).  Much of linear algebra can
still be done over skew fields, but we shall not pursue this
much, if at all, in Math 55.

<p>

Note that (vi) is the only axiom using the multiplicative inverse.
If we drop the existence of multiplicative inverses and axiom (vi),
<em>as well as the condition</em>&nbsp;0&ne;1,
we obtain the structure of a commutative <em>ring</em> with unity.
For example, <STRONG>Z</STRONG> is such a ring which is not a field.
A ring may have nontrivial zero divisors (we shall see an example
of this in class); if it does not, it is called a <em>domain</em>.

<p>

If we also drop axiom (viii) from the ring axioms, we have a
ring with unity which need not be commutative.  An example is
the set of the Hamilton quaternions
<nobr><em>a</em>+<em>bi</em>+<em>cj</em>+<em>dk</em></nobr>
whose coefficients <em>a,b,c,d</em> are all integers.
Curiously if we allow the coefficients to be either all integers
or all <nobr>integers-plus-&frac12;</nobr> we still get a ring,
called the ring of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz_quaternion">Hurwitz
quaternions</a>.

<p>

If <em>F</em> is a ring that need not be a field, the notation
<em>F<sup>*</sup></em> means <b>not</b> <nobr><em>F</em>-{0}</nobr>
but the set of invertible elements of&nbsp;<em>F</em>.
So if <em>F is</em> a field the two notations coincide.
Whether or not <em>F</em> is a field, <em>F<sup>*</sup></em>
is called the <em>multiplicative group</em> of&nbsp;<em>F</em>.
(One sometimes also sees the equivalent term &ldquo;unit group&rdquo;,
because the invertible elements of a ring are called its &ldquo;units&rdquo;.)
You should verify that it is indeed a group.  For example,
the multiplicative group in the ring of Hamilton quaaternions
with integer coefficients consists of the 8 elements
&plusmn;1, &plusmn;<em>i</em>, &plusmn;<em>j</em>, and &plusmn;<em>k</em>;
it is known as the &ldquo;quaternion group&rdquo;.
How large is the unit group of the Hurwitz quaternions?


<HR>

A <em>vector space</em> over a field <em>F</em> is an additive
group <em>V</em> (the &ldquo;vectors&rdquo;)
together with a function (&ldquo;scalar multiplication&rdquo;)
taking a field element (&ldquo;scalar&rdquo;) and a vector to a vector,
as long as this function satisfies the axioms

<UL>
<LI> 1*<em>v=v</em> for all <em>v</em> in <em>V</em>
[so 1 remains a multiplicative identity],
<LI> for all scalars <em>a,b</em> and all vectors <em>u,v</em> we have
<em>a(u+v)=au+av</em> and <em>(a+b)u=au+bu</em>
[distributive properties],
<LI> for all scalars <em>a,b</em> and all vectors <em>v</em> we have
<em>a(bv)=(ab)v</em>
[associative property].
</UL>

(If <em>F</em> is a skew field, there are two kinds of vector spaces,
depending on whether scalar multiplication is
&ldquo;from the left&rdquo; or &ldquo;from the right&rdquo;;
the distinction affects the associative law: does multiplying a vector
first by <em>b</em> and then by <em>a</em> amount to multiplying by
<em>ab</em> or by <em>ba</em>?  The former would be indicaated by
multiplying from the left; the latter, from the right.  Even if you're
not concerned about linear algebra over skew fields, you'll encounter
this issue soon when we compose linear transformations and other functions.)

<p>

Notice that these axioms do not use the multiplicative inverse;
they can thus be used equally when <em>F</em> is any ring
(even a non-commutative ring),
in which case the resulting structure is called a <em>module</em>
over <em>F</em>.  But multiplicative inverses are used to prove most of
the basic theorems on vector spaces, so those theorems do not hold
in the more general setting of modules; for instance one cannot speak
of the dimension of a general module, even over <STRONG>Z</STRONG>.
