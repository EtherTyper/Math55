At least in the beginning of the <strong>linear algebra</strong>
unit, we&rsquo;ll be following the Axler textbook closely enough that
supplementary lecture notes should not be needed.  Some important
extensions/modifications to the treatment in Axler:

<UL>
<LI> [see Axler, page 5]
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(P)"
    target="_blank"><em>Pace</em></a> the boxed note on that page,
 virtually <em>all</em> mathematicians say and write
 <nobr>&ldquo;<em>n</em>-tuple&rdquo;</nobr>
 (more fully, <nobr>&ldquo;ordered <em>n</em>-tuple&rdquo;</nobr>),
 while I cannot recall another instance of &ldquo;list&rdquo; used
 for this as Axler does.
 (One sometimes sees &ldquo;tuple&rdquo; for an
 <nobr><em>n</em>-tuple</nobr> of unspecified length&nbsp;<em>n</em>,
 and &ldquo;ordered pair&rdquo; and perhaps &ldquo;ordered triple&rdquo;,
 &ldquo;ordered quadruple&rdquo;,
 etc. for <nobr><em>n</em> = 2, 3, 4, &hellip;)</nobr>
<LI> [cf. Axler, Notation 1.6 on page 4, and the
 &ldquo;Digression on Fields&rdquo; on page 10]
<br>
Unless noted otherwise, <strong>F</strong> may be an arbitrary
field, not only <strong>R</strong> or <strong>C</strong>.  The
most important fields other than those of real and complex numbers
are the field <strong>Q</strong> of rational numbers, and the
finite fields <strong>Z</strong>/<em>p</em><strong>Z</strong>
(<em>p</em> prime).  Other examples are: the field
<strong>Q</strong>(<em>i</em>) of complex numbers with rational
real and imaginary parts; more generally,
<strong>Q</strong>(<em>d</em><SUP>1/2</SUP>) for any nonsquare
rational number <em>d</em>; the &ldquo;<em>p</em>-adic numbers&rdquo;
<strong>Q</strong><SUB><em>p</em></SUB> (<em>p</em> prime),
of which we&rsquo;ll say more when we study topology next term;
and more exotic finite fields such as the 9-element field
(<strong>Z</strong>/<em>3</em><strong>Z</strong>)(<em>i</em>).
Here&rsquo;s a <A HREF="field.html">review</A> of the axioms for
fields, vector spaces, and related mathematical structures.

<LI> [cf. Axler, p.28 ff.] We define the <em>span</em> of an arbitrary subset
<em>S</em> of (or tuple in) a vector space <em>V</em> as follows:
it is the set of all (finite) linear combinations
<nobr><em>a</em><SUB>1</SUB><em>v</em><SUB>1</SUB> + &hellip; +
<em>a<SUB>n</SUB>v<SUB>n</SUB></em></nobr>
with each <em>v<SUB>i</SUB></em> in <em>S</em> and each
<em>a<SUB>i</SUB></em> in <em>F</em>.  This is still the smallest
vector subspace of <em>V</em> containing <em>S</em>.  In particular,
if <em>S</em> is empty, its span is by definition {0}.  We do <em>not</em> require that <em>S</em> be finite.

<LI> Warning: in general the space <em>F</em>[<em>X</em>]
<nobr>(a.k.a. <em>P</em>(<em>F</em>))</nobr>
of polynomials in <em>X</em>, and its subspaces
<nobr><em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>F</em>)</nobr>
of polynomials of degree at most <em>n</em>,
might not be naturally identified
with a subspace of the space <em>F<sup>F</sup></em> of
functions from <em>F</em> to itself.  The problem is that
two different polynomials may yield the same function.
For example if <em>F</em> is the field of 2 elements 
the polynomial <nobr><em>X</em><sup>2</sup>&minus;<em>X</em></nobr>
gives rise to the zero function.  In general different polynomials
can represent the same function if and only if
<em>F</em> is finite &mdash; do you see why?

<LI> (See also Exercise 11 in Axler 1.C, assigned as part of the first
problem set)<br>
If <em>U<sub>i</sub></em> are any subspaces of a vector space <em>V</em>
then so is their intersection
<nobr><font size="+1">&cap;</font><sub><em>i</em></sub>
 <em>U<sub>i</sub></em></nobr>.  Note that this doesn&rsquo;t specify
a finite intersection: <em>i</em> could range over an
&ldquo;index set&rdquo; <em>I</em> of any cardinality
(so we would write the intersection as
<nobr><font size="+1">&cap;</font><sub><em>i</em><font size="-2">&in;</font><em>I</em></sub>
 <em>U<sub>i</sub></em> ).</nobr>
We don&rsquo;t usually want to intersect an <em>empty</em> family of sets
(do you see why?),
but for subsets of a given set&nbsp;<em>V</em> we can declare that
<nobr><font size="+1">&cap;</font><sub><em>i</em><font size="-2">&in;</font>&emptyset;</sub>
 <em>U<sub>i</sub></em> = <em>V</em>.</nobr>
<LI> For any field (or even any ring) <em>F</em> there is a canonical
 ring homomorphism, call it <em>h</em>, from <b>Z</b> to <em>F</em>.
 &ldquo;Ring homomorphism&rdquo; means:
 <nobr><em>h</em>(0) = 0</nobr>,
 <nobr><em>h</em>(1) = 1</nobr>,
 and for any integers <nobr><em>m</em>, <em>n</em></nobr> we have
 <nobr><em>h</em>(<em>m</em>+<em>n</em>)
  = <em>h</em>(<em>m</em>) + <em>h</em>(<em>n</em>)</nobr> and
 <nobr><em>h</em>(<em>mn</em>)
  = <em>h</em>(<em>m</em>) <em>h</em>(<em>n</em>)</nobr>
  (and <nobr><em>h</em>(&minus;<em>n</em>)
  = &minus;<em>h</em>(<em>n</em>)</nobr>,
  though this follows from the other properties).
But this doesn&rsquo;t quite mean that we get an isomorphic copy of
 <b>Z</b> in <em>F</em>, because <em>h</em> might not be injective.
 Equivalently, the <em>kernel</em> (that is, the preimage
 <nobr><em>h</em><sup>&minus;1</sup>({0})
   = {<em>n</em> : <em>h</em>(<em>n</em>) = 0})</nobr> 
  might be larger than just&nbsp;{0}.  In general, <em>I</em> must be an
  <em>ideal</em>, i.e. an additive subgroup of&nbsp;<b>Z</b> that is
  closed under multiplication by <em>arbitrary</em> integers
  (whether in <em>I</em> or not &mdash; this mimics the definition of
  a subspace, though as it happens for ideals in&nbsp;<b>Z</b>
  it&rsquo;s automatic).  Now ideals in&nbsp;<b>Z</b> are either {0} or
  <nobr>(<em>n</em>) := {<em>cn</em> | <em>c</em> in <b>Z</b>}</nobr>
  for some <em>n</em> (namely the least positive element of the ideal).
  For rings, any <em>n</em> may arise, most easily for the ring
  <nobr><b>Z</b>/<em>n</em><b>Z</b></nobr> of integers mod&nbsp;<em>n</em>.
  But if <em>F</em> is a field and <em>I</em>=(<em>n</em>) then
  <em>n</em> must be either zero or prime, lest <em>F</em> have
  zero divisors (elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>,
  neither zero, for which <em>ab</em>=0).
  This <em>n</em> is then called the <em>characteristic</em> of
  the field&nbsp;<em>F</em>.  The familiar fields
  <nobr><b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>C</b></nobr> all have characteristic zero.
  For any prime <em>p</em>, there are fields of characteristic&nbsp;<em>p</em>,
  notably the &ldquo;prime field&rdquo;
  <nobr><b>Z</b>/<em>p</em><b>Z</b></nobr>
  (mentioned above; this is the key fact from elementary (but nontrivial)
  number theory that any nonzero element of
  <nobr><b>Z</b>/<em>p</em><b>Z</b></nobr> has a multiplicative inverse!).
  This field <nobr><b>Z</b>/<em>p</em><b>Z</b></nobr>
  and other prime fields have important uses in number theory, combinatorics,
  computer science, and elsewhere, often using the linear algebra that
  we develop in Math&nbsp;55a.
 
<LI>[cf. the boxed note on page 42 of Axler] It is natural to wonder whether
<b>every</b> vector space, finite-dimensional or not, has a basis.
The polynomial ring <em>F</em>[<em>z</em>], considered as a vector space
over&nbsp;<em>F</em> (and denoted by a fancy script <em>P</em> in Axler),
does have a basis (powers of <em>z</em>), as does a polynomial ring in
several variables, or even infinitely many (see the next item);
but does <em>F</em><sup>&infin;</sup>?  The answer is yes &mdash;
but only under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice"
 target="_blank">Axiom of Choice</a> (equivalently,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorn%27s_lemma"
  target="_blank">Zorn&rsquo;s Lemma</a>)!
[&ldquo;but only under&rdquo; because it is known that Choice/Zorn is
<em>equivalent</em> to the claim that every vector space has a basis.
Don&rsquo;t spend too much time trying to find an explicit basis for
<em>F</em><sup>&infin;</sup>, or for <b>R</b> as a vector space
over&nbsp;<b>Q</b> (a &ldquo;Hamel basis&rdquo;)&hellip;]
Using the same tool one can prove analogues of some other results in
Chapter&nbsp;2, such as 2.33 (p.41: every linearly independent set
extends to a basis), and thus 2.34 (p.42: every subspace is a
direct summand; again, don&rsquo;t spend too much time trying to do this
explicitly for <b>Q</b> as a subspace of the <b>Q</b>-vector space <b>R</b>,
or for <nobr>&oplus;<sub><em>n</em>&ge;1</sub><em>F</em></nobr>
as a subspace <nobr>of <em>F</em><sup>&infin;</sup></nobr>!).
NB some other results clearly fail in infinite dimensions,
even when we have an explicit basis; e.g. the even powers of&nbsp;<em>z</em>
form a linearly independent subset of&nbsp;<em>F</em>[<em>z</em>]
that has the same cardinality as a basis but is not a basis.
 
<LI> However, 2.31 (p.40: every spanning list contains a basis)
still holds with no further axioms for spanning sets <em>S</em>
of arbitrary size, as long as <em>V</em> is finite dimensional.
The reason is that <em>V</em> has a finite spanning set,
say <em>S</em><sub>0</sub>, and every element of
<em>S</em><sub>0</sub> is a linear combination of elements of <em>S</em>,
and sincelinear combinations are of necessity finite it takes only
a finite subset of <em>S</em> to span <em>S</em><sub>0</sub>
and thus&nbsp;<em>V</em>.  Now apply the proof of 2.31 to this
finite subset.  We may call this generalization &ldquo;2.31+&rdquo;.

<LI>[from the Sep.12 lecture] Here&rsquo;s an extreme example of how
basic theorems about finite-dimensional vector spaces can become
utterly false for finitely-generated modules:
a module generated by just one element 
can have a submodule that is not finitely generated.  Indeed, 
for any field <em>F</em> let <em>A</em> be the ring of polynomials
in infinitely many variables <em>X<sub>j</sub></em>.
[The letter &ldquo;<em>A</em>&rdquo; is a common name for a ring,
from French <em>anneau</em>, cognate with English &ldquo;annulus&rdquo;.]
  As usual
we can regard <em>A</em> as a module over itself, with a single
generator&nbsp;1.  Then a submodule is just an ideal of the ring.
Choose the ideal <em>I</em> generated by all the <em>X<sub>j</sub></em>,
which consists of all polynomials with constant coefficient equal&nbsp;0.
Then if there are infinitely many indices <em>j</em> then <em>I</em>
is infinitely generated; indeed any generating set must be
at least as large as the index set of <nobr><em>j</em>&rsquo;s</nobr>,
so for every cardinal &alefsym; we can make a ring <em>A</em> with a
singly-generated module (namely <em>A</em> itself) and with a submodule
that cannot be generated by fewer than &alefsym; elements. 

<br>

For a subtler example, consider the ring we might call
</nobr>&ldquo;<em>F</em>[<em>X</em><sup>1/2<sup>&infin;</sup></sup>]&rdquo;</nobr>,
consisting of </nobr><em>F</em>-linear</nobr> combinations of monomials
</nobr><em>X</em><sup><em>n</em>/2<sup>k</sup></sup></em></nobr>
for arbitrary nonnegative integers <em>n</em> and&nbsp;<em>k</em>.
Again let <em>I</em> be the ideal generated by the nonconstant monomials,
which is not finitely generated, though there are generating sets
that are &ldquo;only&rdquo; countably infinite.
The new behavior involves the countable generating set
<nobr>{<em>X</em><sup>1/2<sup>k</sup></sup> | k&ge;0}</nobr>:
there is no minimal generating subset, because each
<nobr><em>X</em><sup>1/2<sup>k</sup></sup></nobr>
is a multiple of <nobr><em>X</em><sup>1/2<sup>k'</sup></sup></nobr>
for any <nobr>k'&gt;k</nobr>.  Likewise for the ring generated
by all monomials </nobr><em>X</em><sup><em>r</sup></em></nobr>
with <em>r</em> any nonnegative rational number (or even all
</nobr><em>X</em><sup><em>r</sup></em></nobr>
with <em>r</em> any nonnegative real number).

<br>

(When <em>A</em> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noetherian_ring"
  target="_blank">Noetherian</a>, submodules of finitely-generated modules
<em>are</em> finitely-generated, but might still require more generators;
for example, there are Noetherian rings <em>A</em> with
&ldquo;non-principal ideals&rdquo; <em>I</em>, which give examples of
a 1-generator module with a submodule that requires at least 2 generators.)

<LI> As with the notions of span and linear combination, the definition of
a linear transformation makes sense for modules over any ring <em>A</em>
(whether commutative or not), and in that generality is called an
<nobr><em>A-module homomorphism</em></nobr> (so you now know the
&ldquo;morphisms&rdquo; in the &ldquo;category&rdquo; of
<nobr><em>A</em>-modules</em></nobr>);
when <em>A</em> is a skew field, we still call this a
linear transformation, and the &ldquo;rank-nullity theorem&rdquo;
(3.22, page 63) still holds for finite-dimensional vector spaces
in that context.

<LI> Suppose <em>T</em> : <em>V</em> &rarr; <em>W</em>
is a linear transformation.
Axler&rsquo;s notation for the image of&nbsp;<em>T</em>
was already becoming rather old-fashioned when he wrote the first edition of
his book; these days simply <nobr><em>T</em>(<em>V</em>)</nobr> is common 
(and likewise for any function at all).
The terminology &ldquo;null space&rdquo; (whether one or two words)
for <nobr><em>T</em><sup> &minus;1</sup>({0})</nobr> is also somewhat quaint;
we usually say &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; and write
</nobr>&ldquo;ker(<em>T</em>)&rdquo;</nobr>
[and (L<font size=-2>A</font>)TeX already provides the command
<tt>\ker</tt> to typeset this properly].
While I&rsquo;m at it, best to avoid the use of
<nobr>&ldquo;one-to-one&rdquo;</nobr> to mean 
<nobr>&ldquo;injective&rdquo;</nobr> (see boxed note on page 60),
because it is also sometimes used for
<nobr>&ldquo;bijective&rdquo;</nobr>.

<LI> Please avoid Axler&rsquo;s notation &ldquo;product&rdquo; and
<nobr>&ldquo;<em>V</em> &times; <em>W</em>&thinsp;&rdquo;</nobr> (p.91, 3.71 ff.).
I understand the motivation for this notation: it is formally correct,
and avoids the need to distinguish between &ldquo;external direct sum&rdquo;
(the usual name for that vector space) and &ldquo;internal direct sum&rdquo;
(a vector space sum [within some larger vector space] that happens to be direct).
The problem with this is that in Math 55 (and ubiquitously in the literature)
we shall introduce before long a &ldquo;tensor product&rdquo;
<nobr><em>V</em> &otimes; <em>W</em></nobr> of vector spaces,
whose dimension is the product of the dimensions of
<em>V</em> and&nbsp;<em>W</em> when those two dimensions are finite; and
it would be a much bigger source of confusion to have <em>that</em> notation
coexist with <nobr>&ldquo;<em>V</em> &times; <em>W</em>&thinsp;&rdquo;</nobr>
where the dimensions add.  So please stick with
<nobr>&ldquo;<em>V</em> &oplus; <em>W</em>&thinsp;&rdquo;</nobr>
and the name &ldquo;external direct sum&rdquo; &mdash; or if you must,
&ldquo;Cartesian product&rdquo; to avoid confusion with tensor products.
For a possibly infinite Cartesian product, which is <em>not</em>
the same as a direct sum
(because an element of the direct sum must have only finitely many
nonzero components), we still have the notation
<nobr>&Pi;<sub><em>i</em><font size="-2">&in;<em>I</em></font></sub><em>V<sub>i</sub></em></nobr>
to distinguish the Cartesian product from the direct sum
<nobr>&oplus;<sub><em>i</em><font size="-2">&in;<em>I</em></font></sub><em>V<sub>i</sub></em></nobr>.

<LI> More notes on notation: I understand why Axler wants to distinguish
<em>V'</em> and <em>T'</em> (dual space and transformation)
from <em>V*</em> and <em>T*</em>, and
<em>U</em><sup><font size="-2">0</font></sup> (annihilator) from
<em>U</em><sup><font size="-1">&perp;</font></sup>.
(See the boxed note on page 104.)
I&rsquo;ll try to stick with <em>U</em><sup><font size="-2">0</font></sup>
in this class.  But for the duals, using &ldquo; ' &rdquo; this way
incurs a steep price of the very useful construction exemplified by
&ldquo;let <em>V</em> and <em>V'</em> be vector spaces&rdquo;:
we already have few enough good letters to name mathematical structures
that even &pi; is pressed into double duty (not just 3.14159&hellip; but
also the quotient &pi;rojection from <em>V</em> to <em>V</em>/<em>U</em>).
I&rsquo;ll stick with the common <em>V*</em> and <em>T*</em> here.

<LI> An equivalent statement of the identity (<em>ST</em>)* = <em>T*S*</em>
  (third part of 3.101, page 104 of Axler),
together with (<em>I<sub>V</sub></em>)* = <em>I<sub>V*</sub></em>
  (which Axler might not even bother stating explicitly),
is that duality of vector spaces and linear transformations constitutes a
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor#Covariance_and_contravariance">contravariant
  functor</a>&rdquo; from the category of
<nobr><em>F</em>-vector</nobr> spaces and linear transformations to itself.

<LI> The results about quotient spaces and duality in sections E and F of
Chapter&nbsp;3 are often described in terms of
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_sequence"
  target="_blank">exact sequences</a></em>.
A sequence <nobr>&hellip; &rarr; <em>L</em> &rarr; <em>M</em>
  &rarr; <em>N</em> &rarr; &hellip;</nobr>
of linear transformations (or <nobr><em>A</em>-module</nobr> homomorphisms,
&ldquo;etc.&rdquo;) is said to be &ldquo;exact at&nbsp;<em>M</em>&thinsp;&rdquo;
if the kernel of the map <nobr><em>M</em> &rarr; <em>N</em></nobr>
is the image of the map <nobr><em>L</em> &rarr; <em>M</em></nobr>
(that is, if the elements of&nbsp;<em>M</em> that go to zero in&nbsp;<em>N</em>
are precisely those that come from&nbsp;<em>L</em>).  The sequence is
&ldquo;exact&rdquo; if it is exact at each step with both an incoming
and an outgoing map.  In particular a map
<nobr><em>M</em> &rarr; <em>N</em></nobr> is injective <u>iff</u>
it extends to a sequence <nobr>0 &rarr; <em>M</em> &rarr; <em>N</em></nobr>
that is exact at&nbsp;<em>M</em>, and surjective <u>iff</u>
it extends to a sequence <nobr><em>M</em> &rarr; <em>N</em> &rarr; 0</nobr>
that is exact at&nbsp;<em>N</em>.  (Note that in each case there is no
choice about the function from or to the trivial vector space&nbsp;0,
and likewise at least for modules.)  Thus the map is an isomorphism
<u>iff</u> <nobr>0 &rarr; <em>M</em> &rarr; <em>N</em> &rarr; 0</nobr>
is exact (at both <em>M</em> and&nbsp;<em>N</em>).  Even more easily,
<nobr>0 &rarr; <em>M</em> &rarr; 0</nobr> is exact <u>iff</u> <em>M</em>=0.
A <em>short exact sequence</em> is the next case, with three modules
other than the initial and final&nbsp;0.  The standard example is
<nobr>0 &rarr; <em>L</em> &rarr; <em>M</em>
  &rarr; <em>M</em>/<em>L</em> &rarr; 0</nobr>
where the map <nobr>0 &rarr; <em>L</em> &rarr; <em>M</em></nobr>
is an inclusion map (thus an injection) and the map
<nobr><em>M</em> &rarr; <em>M</em>/<em>L</em> &rarr; 0</nobr>
is the quotient map (thus a surjection).  In general if
<nobr>0 &rarr; <em>L</em> &rarr; <em>M</em> &rarr; <em>N</em> &rarr; 0</nobr>
is a short exact sequence then the injection
<nobr><em>L</em> &rarr; <em>M</em></nobr> identifies <em>L</em> with
a submodule of&nbsp;<em>M</em>, and then the surjection
<nobr><em>M</em> &rarr; <em>N</em></nobr> is identified with the
quotient map.  More generally, <em>any</em> homomorphism 
<nobr><em>L</em> &rarr; <em>M</em></nobr> extends (uniquely up to equivalence)
to an exact sequence with <em>four</em> modules between the outer zeros:
<nobr>0 &rarr; <em>K</em> &rarr; <em>L</em>
 &rarr; <em>M</em> &rarr; <em>N</em> &rarr; 0</nobr>,
where <em>K</em> is the kernel of the map
<nobr><em>L</em> &rarr; <em>M</em></nobr>, and <em>N</em> is its
&ldquo;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cokernel#Intuition"
  target="_blank">cokernel</a></em>&thinsp;&rdquo;, that is, the quotient of
<em>M</em> by the image of&nbsp;<em>L</em>.
<p>
Now consider the case of vector spaces.  Then to each linear transformation
<nobr><em>V</em> &rarr; <em>W</em></nobr> we associate the dual transformation
<nobr><em>V*</em> &larr; <em>W*</em></nobr>, with the dual of a composition
<nobr><em>V</em> &rarr; <em>W</em> &rarr; <em>X</em></nobr>
being the composition of the dual transformations
<nobr><em>V</em>* &larr; <em>W</em>* &larr; <em>X</em>*</nobr>
in reverse order; this makes duality a &ldquo;contravariant functor&rdquo;
on the category of <nobr><em>F</em>-vector</nobr> spaces.  The key fact is
that <em>for finite-dimensional vector spaces, duality preserves exactness</em>
of sequences of linear transformations.  Thus starting from any linear
<nobr><em>V</em> &rarr; <em>W</em></nobr>, we can extend to an exact sequence
<nobr>0 &rarr; <em>U</em> &rarr; <em>V</em>
 &rarr; <em>W</em> &rarr; <em>X</em> &rarr; 0</nobr>
with <em>U</em> the kernel and <em>X</em> the cokernel,
and dualize to deduce the exactness of
<nobr>0 &larr; <em>U*</em> &larr; <em>V*</em> &larr;
  <em>W*</em> &larr; <em>X*</em> &larr; 0</nobr>
with <nobr><em>V*</em> &larr; <em>W*</em></nobr> the dual map.
This immediately encodes Axler 3.108 (page 107): the map
<nobr><em>V</em> &rarr; <em>W</em></nobr> is surjective
<u>iff</u> <em>X</em> is zero <u>iff</u> <em>X*</em> is zero
<u>iff</u> the dual map is injective.  Likewise for 3.110 (p.108)
via the vanishing of <em>U</em> and&nbsp;<em>U*</em>.
With a bit more work we can get the general relations
<nobr>ker(<em>T*</em>) =
  (im(<em>T</em>))<sup><font size="-2">0</font></sup></nobr>
(3.107, p.106) and
<nobr>im(<em>T*</em>) =
  (ker(<em>T</em>))<sup><font size="-2">0</font></sup></nobr>
(3.109, p.107) between the kernels and images of <em>T</em> and its dual,
again assuming that <em>T</em> is a linear map between finite-dimensional
vector spaces.  Conversely, the fact that duality preserves exactness
(for sequences of linear maps between finite-dimensional vector spaces)
can be deduced as a special case of 3.107 and 3.109.

<LI> Another way to think about the eigen-basics: &ldquo;Lemma 5.0&rdquo;:
  If <em>T</em> is an operator on any vector space&nbsp;<em>V</em>,
  and &lambda; any scalar, then <em>U</em> is an invariant subspace
  for&nbsp;<em>T</em> <u>iff</u> it is an invariant subspace for
  <nobr><em>T</em> &minus; &lambda;<em>I<sub>V</sub></em></nobr>.
  So, for instance, since ker&nbsp;<em>T</em> is an invariant subspace,
  so is
  <nobr>ker(<em>T</em> &minus; &lambda;<em>I<sub>V</sub></em>)</nobr>,
  a.k.a. the <nobr>&lambda;-eigenspace</nobr>.
<LI> Yet another note on notation: Axler&rsquo;s name
 &ldquo;<em>T/U</em>&thinsp;&rdquo; (for the operator on <em>V/U</em>
 induced from the action of&nbsp;<em>T</em> on a vector space <em>V</em>
 with an invariant subspace&nbsp;<em>U</em>, see 5.14 on p.137)
 is a nice notation, but (unlike
  <nobr><em>T</em>&thinsp;|<sub><em>U</em></sub></nobr>
 for the restriction of&nbsp;<em>T</em> to&nbsp;<em>U</em>)
 is seen rarely if at all in the research literature.
 Normally it will be called plain <em>T</em>, or possibly
 <tt>\bar{T}</tt> (since it is constructed by descending to <em>V/U</em>
 the composition of <em>T</em> with the quotient map
 <nobr><em>V</em> &rarr; <em>V/U</em></nobr>).

<LI> Let <em>T</em> be a linear operator on <em>V</em>.  The algebraic
 properties of polynomial evaluation at&nbsp;<em>T</em> can be summarized
 by saying that the map <nobr>from <em>F</em>[<em>X</em>]</nobr>
 <nobr>to End(<em>V</em>)</nobr> that takes any polynomial <em>P</em>
 to <nobr><em>P</em>(<em>T</em>)</nobr> is not just linear but a
<em>ring homomorphism</em>.  [Since <nobr><em>F</em>[<em>X</em>]</nobr>
is a commutative ring, so is the image of this homomorphism, even though
<nobr>End(<em>V</em>)</nobr> is not commutative once
<nobr>dim(<em>V</em>) &gt; 1</nobr>.]  In particular the kernel
is an ideal <nobr>in <em>F</em>[<em>X</em>]</nobr>; when <em>V</em>
is finite dimensional, this ideal must be nonzero, and its generator is
what we shall call the &ldquo;minimal polynomial&rdquo; of&nbsp;<em>T</em>.
<em>Special case:</em> if <em>V</em> is <em>F</em> itself, then we
naturally identify <nobr>End(<em>V</em>)</nobr> with&nbsp;<em>F</em>,
and we get for any field element <em>x</em>
the evaluation homomorphism <nobr>from <em>F</em>[<em>X</em>]</nobr>
to&nbsp;<em>F</em> that takes any polynomial to its value at&nbsp;<em>x</em>.


<LI> Axler proves the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using
complex analysis, which cannot be assumed in Math 55a
(we&rsquo;ll get to it at the end of 55b).
<A HREF="fta.pdf">Here</A>&rsquo;s a proof using the topological tools
we&rsquo;ll develop at the start of 55b.
(Axler gives one standard complex-analytic proof in 4.13 on page 124.)

<LI> Triangular matrices are intimately related with &ldquo;flags&rdquo;.
A (complete) <em>flag</em> in a finite dimensional vector space <em>V</em>
is a sequence of subspaces {0}=<em>V</em><SUB>0</SUB>,
<em>V</em><SUB>1</SUB>, <em>V</em><SUB>2</SUB>, &hellip;,
<em>V<SUB>n</SUB></em>=<em>V</em>, with each
<em>V<SUB>i</SUB></em> of dimension <em>i</em> and containing
<em>V</em><SUB><em>i</em>&minus;1</SUB>.  A basis
<nobr><em>v</em><SUB>1</SUB>, <em>v</em><SUB>2</SUB>, &hellip;,
<em>v<SUB>n</SUB></em></nobr>
determines a flag: <em>V<SUB>i</SUB></em> is the span of the first
<em>i</em> basis vectors.  Another basis
<nobr><em>w</em><SUB>1</SUB>, <em>w</em><SUB>2</SUB>, &hellip;,
<em>w<SUB>n</SUB></em></nobr>
determines the same flag if and only if each
<em>w<SUB>i</SUB></em> is a linear combination of
<nobr><em>v</em><SUB>1</SUB>, <em>v</em><SUB>2</SUB>, &hellip;,
<em>v<SUB>i</SUB></em></nobr>
(necessarily with nonzero <em>v<SUB>i</SUB></em> coefficient).
The <em>standard flag</em> in <em>F<SUB>n</SUB></em> is the flag
obtained in this way from the standard basis of unit vectors
<nobr><em>e</em><SUB>1</SUB>, <em>e</em><SUB>2</SUB>, &hellip;,
<em>e<SUB>n</SUB></em></nobr>.
The punchline is that, just as a diagonal matrix is one that respects
the standard basis (equivalently, the associated decomposition of
<em>V</em> as a direct sum of 1-dimensional subspaces),
<em>an upper-triangular matrix is one that respects the standard
flag.</em>
Note that the <em>i</em>-th diagonal entry of a triangular matrix
gives the action on the one-dimensional quotient space
<em>V<SUB>i</SUB></em>/<em>V</em><SUB><em>i</em>&minus;1</SUB>
(each <em>i</em>=1,&hellip;,<em>n</em>).

While the third edition of Axler includes quotients and duality,
it still lacks <strong>tensor algebra</strong>.
This is no surprise, but it will not stop us in Math&nbsp;55!
<A href="tensor.pdf">Here</a>&rsquo;s an introduction
[As you might guess from <tt>\oplus</tt>,
the TeXism for the tensor-product symbol is <tt>\otimes</tt>.]

<UL>
<LI> One of many applications is the <strong>trace</strong> of
an operator on a finite dimensional <em>F</em>-vector space <em>V</em>.
This is a linear map from Hom(<em>V</em>,<em>V</em>) to <em>F</em>.
We can define it simply as the composition of two maps:
our identification of <nobr>Hom(<em>V</em>,<em>V</em>)</nobr> with
the tensor product of <em>V</em><sup>*</sup> and <em>V</em>,
and the natural map from this tensor product to <em>F</em>
coming from the bilinear map taking
<nobr>(<em>v</em><sup>*</sup>,<em>v</em>)</nobr>
to <nobr><em>v</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>v</em>)</nobr>.
We shall see that this is the same as the classical definition:
the trace of <em>T</em> is the sum of the diagonal entries of
the matrix of <em>T</em> with respect to any basis.
The coordinate-independent construction via tensor algebra 
explains why the trace does not change under change of basis.
(The invariance can also be proved by checking explicitly that
<em>AB</em> and <em>BA</em> have the same trace for any square matrices
<nobr><em>A</em>, <em>B</em></nobr> of the same size.)

<LI> Here are some basic definitions and facts about general 
<A HREF="norm.html"><strong>norms</strong></A>
on real and complex vector spaces. 

<LI> Just as we can study bilinear symmetric forms
on a vector space over any field, not just <strong>R</strong>,
we can study sesquilinear conjugate-symmetric forms
on a vector space over any field <em>with a conjugation</em>,
not just <strong>C</strong>.
Here a &ldquo;conjugation&rdquo; on a field <em>F</em> is a field automorphism
<nobr>&sigma;:<em>F</em>&rarr;<em>F</em></nobr>
such that &sigma; is not the identity
but &sigma;<sup>2</sup> is (that is, &sigma; is an involution).
Given a basis {<em>v<sub>i</sub></em>} for&nbsp;<em>F</em>,
a sesquilinear form &lang;.,.&rang; on&nbsp;<em>F</em>
is determined by the field elements
<nobr><em>a</em><sub><em>i,j</em></sub>
= &lang;<em>v</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,<em>v</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>&rang;,</nobr>
and is conjugate-symmetric if and only if
<nobr><em>a<sub>j,i</sub></em> = &sigma;(<em>a<sub>i,j</sub></em>)</nobr>
for all <em>i,j</em>.
Note that the &ldquo;diagonal entries&rdquo; <em>a<sub>i,i</sub></em>
&mdash; and more generally &lang;<em>v</em>,<em>v</em>&rang;
for any <em>v</em> in&nbsp;<em>V</em> &mdash; must be elements
of the subfield of <em>F</em> fixed by&nbsp;&sigma;.
<li> &ldquo;Sylvester&rsquo;s Law of Inertia&rdquo; states that
for a nondegenerate pairing on a finite-dimensional vector space
<em>V</em>/<em>F</em>, where either
<em>F</em>=<strong>R</strong> and the pairing is
bilinear and symmetric, or
<em>F</em>=<strong>C</strong> and the pairing is
sesquilinear and conjugate-symmetric,
<em>
the counts of positive and negative inner products
for an orthogonal basis constitute an invariant of the pairing
</em>
and do not depend on the choice of orthogonal basis.
(This invariant is known as the &ldquo;signature&rdquo; of the pairing.)
The key trick in proving this result is as follows.
Suppose <em>V</em> is the orthogonal direct sum of subspaces
<em>U</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>U</em><sub>2</sub>
for which the pairing is positive definite on <em>U</em><sub>1</sub>
and negative definite on <em>U</em><sub>2</sub>.
Then any subspace <em>W</em> of <em>V</em>
on which the pairing is positive definite
has dimension no greater than dim(<em>U</em><sub>1</sub>).
Proof: On the intersection of <em>W</em> with <em>U</em><sub>2</sub>,
the pairing is both positive and negative definite;
hence that subspace is {0}.  The claim follows by a dimension count,
and we quickly deduce Sylvester&rsquo;s Law.

<li> Over any field not of characteristic 2,
we know that for any non-degenerate
symmetric pairing on a finite-dimensional vector space
there is an orthogonal basis, or equivalently
a choice of basis such that the pairing is
(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)=&Sigma;<sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>a<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;x<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;y<sub>i</sub></em>)
for some nonzero scalars <em>a<sub>i</sub></em>.
But in general it can be quite hard to decide whether
two different collections of <em>a<sub>i</sub></em>
yield isomorphic pairings.  Even over <strong>Q</strong>
the answer is already tricky in dimensions 2 and 3,
and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s known in a vector space of arbitrary dimension.
Over a finite field of odd size there are always exactly two
possibilities, as I think we&rsquo;ll see in a few weeks.

<li> If <em>U</em> is a subspace of inner-product space <em>V</em>,
but not necessarily finite dimensional, there is not generally a complement:
one can still define <em>U</em><sup>&perp;</sup>, but the direct orthogonal
sum <nobr><em>U</em> &oplus; <em>U</em><sup>&perp;</sup></nobr> might be
strictly smaller than&nbsp;<em>V</em>.  What then happens to
<nobr>6.56 (p.198 in 6.C)</nobr>, which describes the orthogonal projection
<nobr><em>P<sub>U</sub></em>(<em>v</em>)</nobr> as the vector
in&nbsp;<em>U</em> closest to&nbsp;<em>v</em>
(i.e., minimizing the norm <nobr>||<em>v</em>&minus;<em>u</em>||</nobr>)?
Well, <em>if</em> there exists such&nbsp;<em>u</em> then indeed
 <nobr><em>v</em>&minus;<em>u</em></nobr> is orthogonal to&nbsp;<em>U</em>,
but in general the minimum need not be attained: at best we can construct
a sequence of vectors <em>u<sub>n</sub></em> in&nbsp;<em>U</em> such that
<nobr>||<em>v</em>&minus;<em>u<sub>n</sub></em>||</nobr> <em>approaches</em>
<nobr>inf<sub><em>u</em><font size="-2">&in;</font><em>U</em></sub>||<em>v</em>&minus;<em>u</em>||</nobr>.
It then follows from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius%27_theorem"
 target="_blank">Apollonius&rsquo; theorem</a>
(see the front cover of Axler! and also Exercise 31 of 6.A, page&nbsp;179)
that the <em>u<sub>n</sub></em> constitute a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence"
 target="_blank">Cauchy sequence</a>
in&nbsp;<em>U</em> (else <nobr>(<em>u<sub>m</em>+<em>u<sub>n</em>)/2</nobr>
is too close to&nbsp;<em>v</em>).
So if <em>U</em> is <em>complete</em> with respect to the norm distance
then there is a nearest vector and we can proceed as before.
But in general infinite-dimensional inner product spaces are not complete
(the complete ones are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space"
 target="_blank">Hilbert spaces</a>, and that is a very special case).
We shall say a lot more about completeness and related notions
at the start of Math&nbsp;55b.

<li> A regular graph of degree <em>d</em> is a
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_graph"
 target="_blank">Moore graph</a></em> of girth 5
if any two different vertices are linked by a unique path of length
at most&nbsp;2.  Such a graph necessarily has
<nobr><em>n</em> = 1 + <em>d</em> + <em>d</em>(<em>d</em>&minus;1)
= <em>d</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 </nobr> vertices.
Let <em>A</em> be the adjacency matrix, and
<strong>1</strong> the all-ones vector.  Then (because each vertex
has degree&nbsp;<em>d</em>) <strong>1</strong> is a
<nobr><em>d</em>-eigenvector</nobr> of&nbsp;<em>A</em>.
We have
<nobr>(1 + <em>A</em> + <em>A</em><sup>2</sup>) <em>v</em> =
<em>d v </em> + &lang;<em>v</em>, <strong>1</strong>&rang; <strong>1</strong>
</nobr> for all <em>v</em>
(proof: check on unit vectors and use linearity).
Thus <em>A</em> takes the orthogonal complement
<nobr>of <strong>R</strong>&middot;<strong>1</strong></nobr>
to itself and satisfies
<nobr>(1 + <em>A</em> + <em>A</em><sup>2</sup>) = <em>d</em></nobr>
on that space.  Since this quadratic equation has distinct roots
<em>m</em> and <nobr>&minus;1&minus;<em>m</em></nobr>
for some <nobr> <em>m</em> &gt; 0 </nobr> (namely the positive root of
<nobr>(1 + <em>m</em> + <em>m</em><sup>2</sup>) = <em>d</em></nobr>),
it follows that the orthogonal complement
<nobr>of <strong>R</strong>&middot;<strong>1</strong></nobr>
is the direct sum of the corresponding eigenspaces.
Let <em>d</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>d</em><sub>2</sub>
be their dimensions.  These sum to
<nobr><em>n</em>&minus;1 = <em>d</em><sup>2</sup></nobr>, and satisfy
<nobr><em>md</em><sub>1</sub> + (&minus;1&minus;<em>m</em>)<em>d</em><sub>2</sub> + <em>d</em> = 0</nobr>
because the matrix <em>A</em> has trace zero.  This lets us solve
for <em>d</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>d</em><sub>2</sub>.
in particular we find that their difference is
<nobr>(2<em>d</em> &minus; <em>d</em><sup>2</sup>) / (2<em>m</em>+1)</nobr>.
Since that&rsquo;s an integer, either <nobr><em>d</em>=2</nobr>
(giving the pentagon graph) or <em>m</em> is an integer.
Substituting <nobr><em>m</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>m</em> + 1</nobr>
for&nbsp;<em>d</em>, we find that
<nobr>16(<em>d</em><sub>1</sub> &minus; <em>d</em><sub>2</sub>)</nobr>
is an integer plus <nobr>15/(2<em>m</em>+1)</nobr>, whence
<em>m</em> is one of 0, 1, 2, or 7.  The first of these is impossible,
and the others give <nobr><em>d</em> = 3</nobr>, 7, or&nbsp;57
as claimed.
<p>
It is clear that the pentagon is the unique Moore graph of girth&nbsp;5,
and degree&nbsp;2, and it is not hard to check that the Petersen graph
is the unique example with <nobr><em>d</em> = 3</nobr>.  For
<nobr><em>d</em> = 7</nobr> there is again a unique graph up to
an interesting group of automorphisms; see this
<A HREF="http://math.harvard.edu/~elkies/Misc/hsgraph.pdf"
target="_blank">proof outline</A>, which also lets one count
the automorphisms of this graph.
<!--  There is no spectral graph theory
there, but this approach is suggested by the inequality you&rsquo;ll prove
in the fifth problem of <A HREF="p7.pdf">problem set&nbsp;7</A>:

the smallest possible number of edges between them?
-->
<li> Why the name &ldquo;spectral theorem&rdquo;?  The set (or sometimes the
  &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset
   target="_blank">multiset</a>&rdquo;) of eigenvalues
 of a linear operator on a vector space&nbsp;<em>V</em>
 is often called its
 &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum#Mathematics"
 target="_blank">spectrum</a>&rdquo;, especially when
 <em>V</em> is a real or complex vector space, either
  finite or infinite dimensional.  This is related with the
 visual (and by extension the electromagnetic) spectrum, for reasons that
 would take us much too far into wave and quantum mechanics,
 so we shall say little more of that here (but you may encounter it again
 in your physics class(es)).

We&rsquo;ll <em>define</em> the determinant of an operator <em>T</em>
on a finite dimensional space <em>V</em> as follows:
<em>T</em> induces a linear operator
<nobr><font size="+1">&wedge;</font><sup><em>n</em></sup>(<em>T</em>)</nobr>
on the top exterior power
<nobr><font size="+1">&wedge;</font><sup><em>n</em></sup>(<em>V</em>)</nobr> of&nbsp;<em>V</em>
(where <nobr><em>n</em> = dim <em>V</em></nobr>);
this exterior power is one-dimensional,
so an operator on it is multiplication by some scalar;
det(<em>T</em>) is by definition the scalar corresponding to
<nobr><font size="+1">&wedge;</font><sup><em>n</em></sup>(<em>T</em>)</nobr>.
The &ldquo;top exterior power&rdquo;
is a subspace of the &ldquo;exterior algebra&rdquo;
<nobr><font size="+1">&wedge;</font><sup>&bullet;</sup>(<em>V</em>)</nobr>
 of&nbsp;<em>V</em>,
which is the quotient of the tensor algebra by
the ideal generated by
<nobr>{<em>v</em> &otimes; <em>v</em>: <em>v</em> in <em>V</em>}</nobr>.
We&rsquo;ll still have to construct the sign homomorphism from the
symmetry group of order dim(<em>V</em>) to <nobr>{1,&minus;1}</nobr>
to make sure that this exterior algebra is as large
as we expect it to be, and that in particular that
the (dim(<em>V</em>))-th exterior power has dimension 1
rather than zero.

  This is not in Axler but can be found in any introductory text in

    &rarr; GL<em><sub>n</sub></em>(<em>F</em>)
    &rarr; <em>F</em><sup>*</sup>

  <nobr><strong>Z</strong><sup>*</sup> = {&plusmn;1}.</nobr>
<p>
Some more tidbits about exterior algebra:
<ul>
<li>If <em>w</em>, <em>w</em>' are elements of the
 <em>m</em>-th and <em>m</em>'-th exterior powers of <em>V</em>,
 then <em>ww</em>'=(&minus;1)<sup><em>mm</em>'</sup><em>w</em>'<em>w</em>;
 that is, <em>w</em> and <em>w</em>' commute
 unless <em>m</em> and <em>m</em>' are both odd
 in which case they anticommute.
<li>If <em>m</em>+<em>m</em>'=<em>n</em>=dim(<em>V</em>)
 then the natural pairing from the
 <em>m</em>-th and <em>m</em>'-th exterior powers
 to the <em>n</em>-th is nondegenerate,
 and so identifies the <nobr><em>m</em>'-th</nobr> exterior power
 canonically with the dual of the <nobr><em>m</em>-th</nobr>
 <em>tensored with the top (n-th) exterior power</em>.
<li> In particular, if <em>m</em>=1,
 and <em>T</em> is any invertible operator on <em>V</em>,
 then we find that the induced action of <em>T</em>
 on the (<em>n</em>&minus;1)st exterior power
 is the same as its action on <em>V</em><sup>*</sup>
 multiplied by det(<em>T</em>).
 This yields the formula connecting the inverse and cofactor matrix
 of an invertible matrix (a formula which you may also know
 in the guise of &ldquo;Cramer&rsquo;s rule&rdquo;).
<!--
<p>
 One consequence of this formula is that
 an <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> integer matrix <em>A</em>
 had an inverse with integer entries if and only if
 |det(<em>A</em>)|=1.  This in turn implies that
 |det(<em>M</em>)| is an invariant of the lattice
 <em>L</em>=<em>M</em><strong>Z</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup>.
 In 55b we&rsquo;ll interpret this invariant as
 the &ldquo;covolume&rdquo; of <em>L</em>, that is,
 the volume of the <em>n</em>-dimensional torus
 <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup>/<em>L</em>.
<p>
-->
<li> For each <em>m</em> there is a natural non-degenerate pairing
 between the <em>m</em>-th exterior powers of
 <em>V</em> and <em>V</em><sup>*</sup>,
 which identifies these exterior powers with each other&rsquo;s dual.
</ul>
More will be said about exterior algebra when differential forms
appear in Math 55b.
<p>
We&rsquo;ll also show that a symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix
is positive definite <u>iff</u> all its eigenvalues are positive
<u>iff</u> it has positive principal minors
(the &ldquo;principal minors&rdquo; are the determinants
of the square submatrices of all orders containing the (1,1) entry).
More generally we&rsquo;ll show that the eigenvalue signs determine
the signature, as does the sequence of signs of principal minors
if they are all nonzero.  More precisely: an invertible
symmetric/Hermitian matrix has signature
<nobr>(<em>r</em>,<em>s</em>)</nobr> where
<em>r</em> is the number of positive eigenvalues and
<em>s</em> is the number of negative eigenvalues;
if its principal minors are all nonzero then
<em>r</em> is the number of <em>j</em> in
<nobr>{1,2,&hellip;,<em>n</em>}</nobr> such that the
<nobr><em>j</em>-th</nobr> and <nobr>(<em>j</em>&minus;1)-st</nobr> minors
have the same sign, and
<em>s</em> is the number of <em>j</em> in that range such that the
<nobr><em>j</em>-th</nobr> and <nobr>(<em>j</em>&minus;1)-st</nobr> minors
have opposite sign [for <nobr><em>j</em>=1</nobr> we always count
the &ldquo;zeroth minor&rdquo; as being the positive number&nbsp;1].
This follows inductively from the fact that the determinant has sign
<nobr>(&minus;1)<sup><em>s</em></sup></nobr> and the signature
<nobr>(<em>r</em>',<em>s</em>')</nobr> of the restriction of a pairing
to a subspace has
<nobr><em>r</em>' &le; <em>r</em></nobr> and
<nobr><em>s</em>' &le; <em>s</em></nobr>.
<p>
For positive definiteness, we have the two further
equivalent conditions: the symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix
<em>A</em>=(<em>a<sub>ij</sub></em>) is positive definite
<u>iff</u> there is a basis (<em>v<sub>i</sub></em>)
of <strong>F</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup> such that
<nobr><em>a<sub>ij</sub></em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;&lang;<em>v<sub>i</sub></em>,<em>v<sub>j</sub></em>&rang;</nobr>
for all <em>i</em>,<em>j</em>, and
<u>iff</u> there is an invertible matrix <em>B</em> such that
<em>A</em>=<em>B</em><sup>*</sup><em>B</em>.
For example, the matrix with entries 1/(<em>i</em>+<em>j</em>&minus;1)
(&ldquo;Hilbert matrix&rdquo;) is positive-definite, because it is
the matrix of inner products (integrals on [0,1]) of the basis
1,<em>x</em>,<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>,&hellip;,<em>x</em><sup><em>n</em>&minus;1</sup>
for the polynomials of degree &lt;<em>n</em>.
See the 10th problem set for a calculus-free proof of the
positivity of the Hilbert matrix, and an evaluation of its determinant.
<br>
For any matrix <em>B</em> (not necessarily invertible or even square)
with columns <nobr><em>v<sub>i</sub></em></nobr>,
the matrix <nobr><em>B</em><sup>*</sup><em>B</em></nobr> with entries
<nobr><em>a<sub>ij</sub></em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;&lang;<em>v<sub>i</sub></em>,<em>v<sub>j</sub></em>&rang;</nobr>
is known as the <em>Gram matrix</em> of the columns of&nbsp;<em>B</em>.
It is invertible iff those columns are linearly independent.
If we add an <nobr>(<em>n</em>+1)-st</nobr> vector, the determinant of
the Gram matrix increases by a factor equal to the squared distance
between this vector and the span of the columns of&nbsp;<em>B</em>.

You&rsquo;ll use this too in PS10.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(2) For any vector <em>v</em>, there exists a nonnegative integer
<em>k</em> such that <em>T<sup>k</sup>v</em>=0;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(3) <em>T<sup>n</sup></em>=0, where <em>n</em>=dim(<em>V</em>).
<br>
Note that (1) and (2) make no mention of the dimension,
but are still not equivalent for operators on infinite-dimensional spaces.
(For example, consider differentiation on the
<nobr><b>R</b>-vector space</nobr> <nobr><b>R</b>[<em>x</em>]</nobr>.)
We readily deduce the further equivalent conditions:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(4) There exists a basis for <em>V</em> for which
<em>T</em> has an upper-triangular matrix
with every diagonal entry equal zero;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(5) Every upper-triangular matrix for <em>T</em>
has zeros on the diagonal,
and there exists at least one upper-triangular matrix for <em>T</em>.
<br>
Recall that the second part of (5) is automatic
if <em>F</em> is algebraically closed.
<li> The space of generalized 0-eigenvectors
(the maximal subspace on which <em>T</em> is nilpotent)
is sometimes called the <em>nilspace</em> of <em>T</em>.
It is an invariant subspace.  When <em>V</em> is finite dimensional,
<em>V</em> is the direct sum of the nilspace and another invariant
subspace <em>V'</em>, consisting of the intersection of the subspaces
<em>T<sup>k</sup></em>(<em>V</em>) as <em>k</em> ranges over all
positive integers (8.5). This can be used to prove Cayley-Hamilton
using the standard definition of the characteristic polynomial as
<nobr>det(<em>xI</em>&minus;<em>T</em>)</nobr>.
<li> An example in infinite dimension when (8.5) fails:
<em>V</em> is the real vector space of continuous functions from
<b>R</b> to&nbsp;<b>R</b>, and <em>T</em> is multiplication
by&nbsp;<em>x</em>.  [That is a useful counterexample for many other
aspects of &ldquo;eigenstuff&rdquo; when we try to go beyond
finite dimension; for example, there are no eigenvectors, but
for <em>every</em> real number &lambda; the operator
<nobr>&lambda;<em>I</em>&minus;<em>T</em></nobr> is not invertible!]
<li> The dimension of the space of generalized <em>c</em>-eigenvalues
(i.e., of the nilspace of <em>T&minus;cI</em>) is usually called the
<em>algebraic</em> multiplicity of <em>c</em>
(since it&rsquo;s the multiplicity of <em>c</em>
as a root of the characteristic polynomial of <em>T</em>),
to distinguish it from the &ldquo;geometric multiplicity&rdquo;
which is the dimension of <nobr>ker(<em>T&minus;cI</em>)</nobr>.

Our source for <em>representation theory</em> of finite groups
(on finite-dimensional vector spaces over&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>)
will be Artin&rsquo;s <em>Algebra</em>, Chapter&nbsp;9.  We&rsquo;ll omit
sections&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;10 (which require not just topology and
calculus but also, at least for &sect;3, some material beyond 55b
to do properly, namely the construction of Haar measures);
also we won&rsquo;t spend much time on &sect;7, which works out in detail
the representation theory of a specific group that Artin
calls&nbsp;<em>I</em> (the icosahedral group,
<nobr>a.k.a. <em>A</em><sub>5</sub></nobr>).
There are many other sources for this material,
some of which take a somewhat different point of view via the
&ldquo;group algebra&rdquo; <nobr><strong>C</strong>[<em>G</em>]</nobr>
of a finite group&nbsp;<em>G</em> (a.k.a. the algebra of
functions on&nbsp;<em>G</em> under convolution).
See for instance Chapter&nbsp;1 of <em>Representation Theory</em>
by Fulton and Harris (mentioned in class).  A canonical treatment
of representations of finite groups is
Serre&rsquo;s <em>Linear Representations of Finite Groups</em>,
which is the only entry for this chapter in the list of
&ldquo;Suggestions for Further Reading&rdquo; at the end of Artin&rsquo;s book
(see p.604).

<p>

While we&rsquo;ll work almost exclusively over&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>,
most of the results work equally well (though with somewhat different
proofs) over any field <em>F</em> that contains the roots of unity
of order <nobr>#(<em>G</em>)</nobr>, as long as the characteristic
of&nbsp;<em>F</em> is not a factor of <nobr>#(<em>G</em>)</nobr>.
Without roots of unity, many more results are different,
but there is still a reasonably satisfactory theory available.
Dropping the characteristic condition leads to much trickier territory,
e.g. even Maschke&rsquo;s theorem (every finite-dimensional
representation is a direct sum of irreducibles) fails;
some natural problems are still unsolved!

<p>

Here&rsquo;s an alternative viewpoint on representations of a finite group
<em>G</em> (not in Artin, though you can find it elsewhere, e.g.
Fulton-Harris pages 36ff.): a representation of&nbsp;<em>G</em> over
a field&nbsp;<em>F</em> is equivalent to a module for the
<em>group ring</em> 
<nobr><em>F</em>[<em>G</em>]</nobr>.
The group ring is an associative <nobr><em>F</em>-algebra</nobr>
(commutative iff <em>G</em> is commutative) that consists of the
formal <nobr><em>F</em>-linear</nobr> combinations of group elements.
This means that <nobr><em>F</em>[<em>G</em>]</nobr>
is <nobr><em>F<sup>G</sup></em></nobr> as an
<nobr><em>F</em>-vector</nobr> space,
and the algebra structure is defined by setting
<nobr><em>e</em><sub><em>g</em><sub>1</sub></sub><em>e</em><sub><em>g</em><sub>2</sub></sub>
= <em>e</em><sub><em>g</em><sub>1</sub><em>g</em><sub>2</sub></sub></nobr>
for all <nobr><em>g</em><sub>1</sub><em>, g</em><sub>2</sub></nobr>
in&nbsp;<em>G</em>, together with the
<nobr><em>F</em>-bilinearity</nobr> of the product.
This means that if we identify elements of the group ring with
functions <nobr><em>G</em>&rarr;<em>F</em></nobr> then the
multiplication rule is
<nobr>(<em>f</em><sub>1</sub> * <em>f</em><sub>2</sub>)(<em>g</em>)
= &Sigma;<sub><em>g</em><sub>1</sub><em>g</em><sub>2</sub>=<em>g</em></sub>
<em>f</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>g</em><sub>1</sub>) <em>f</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>g</em><sub>2</sub>)</nobr>
&mdash; yes, it&rsquo;s convolution again.  To identify an
<nobr><em>F</em>[<em>G</em>]-module</nobr> with a representation,
use the action of <em>F</em> to define the vector space structure,
and let <nobr>&rho;(<em>g</em>)</nobr> act by multipliction by
the unit vector&nbsp;<em>e<sub>g</sub></em>.  In particular,
the regular representation is <nobr><em>F</em>[<em>G</em>]</nobr>
regarded in the usual way as a module over itself.  If we identify
the image of this representation with certain permutation matrices
of <nobr>order #(<em>G</em>)</nobr>, we get an explicit model of
<nobr><em>F</em>[<em>G</em>]</nobr> as a subalgebra of the
algebra of square matrices the same order.  For example, if
<nobr><em>G</em> = <strong>Z</strong>/<em>n</em><strong>Z</strong></nobr>
we recover the algebra of circulant matrices of order&nbsp;<em>n</em>.
