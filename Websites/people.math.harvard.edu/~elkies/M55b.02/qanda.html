<strong><font color=red>Q</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
What will Math 55b cover?
<p>
<strong><font color=green>A</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Most of the Calculus topics from Rudin (Chapters 5-10),
fortified with 55 vitamins, minerals,
and secret herbs&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;spices;
and a selection of topics in Fourier analysis from K&ouml;rner.

<strong><font color=red>Q</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Will Math 55b be harder than Math 55a?
<p>
<strong><font color=green>A</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
I expect so; at any rate it should be no <em>easier</em>
than Math 55a for most students.

<strong><font color=red>Q</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
What's ``thrice''?  The word occurs in PS1, Problem 1/ii.
<p>
<strong><font color=green>A</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
It's in the dictionary -- once : twice : thrice :: 1 : 2 : 3.
As far as I know the sequence ``once, twice, thrice''
has no fourth term in English
(though it does have a zeroth term of sorts in ``never'').

&nbsp; &nbsp;
How do I get TeX to do the &lt;&lt; notation?
The output of ``f&lt;&lt;g'' looks really ugly.
<p>
<strong><font color=green>A</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Use \ll (and likewise \gg for &gt;&gt;).  See
<A HREF="http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/Symbols.pdf"
TARGET="_blank">This PDF document</A>
for an extensive list of such commands.

#7 on PS1 reads
``Solve problem 27 on page 119 (which also requires problem 26).''
Does that mean I should also solve problem 26?
<p>
<strong><font color=green>A</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Yes.

<strong><font color=red>Q</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
What's this about the ``Stone-Cech compactification''?
<p>
<strong><font color=green>A</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
See Dunford &amp; Schwartz, <em>Linear Operators</em> I, p.274 ff.;
for one overview, see
<A HREF="http://noisefactory.co.uk/maths/stone-cech.html"
TARGET="_blank">this Web page</A>.

<font size=-1>
(The name Cech should have a v-shaped diacritical mark
above the capital C; this can be done in LaTeX with ``\v{C}'',
but does not seem to have a standard HTML command.
The pronunciation is like the first syllable of ``Chekhov''.)

<strong><font color=red>Q</font></strong>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Where exactly can I find that article on the generalization
of Calabi's trick to evaluate zeta(<em>n</em>) for even
integers <em>n</em>&gt;0 (and the analogous alternating sums
for odd <em>n</em>&gt;0)?
