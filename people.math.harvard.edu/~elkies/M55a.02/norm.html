Math 55a: Norm basics
</H2>

Let the <em>F</em> be either of the fields
<strong>R</strong>, <strong>C</strong>,
and let <em>V</em> be a vector space over <em>F</em>.
A <em>norm</em> on <em>F</em> is a real-valued function ||&middot;||
on <em>V</em> satisfying the following axioms:
<OL>
<LI> Positivity: ||0||=0, and ||<em>v</em>|| is a positive real number
for all nonzero vectors <em>v</em>.
<LI> Homogeneity: ||<em>cv</em>|| = |c| ||<em>v</em>||
for all scalars <em>c</em> and vectors <em>v</em>.
<LI> Subadditivity:
||<em>v</em>+<em>w</em>|| &lt;= ||<em>v</em>|| + ||<em>w</em>||
for all vectors <em>v</em>,<em>w</em> in <em>V</em>.
</OL>
A normed vector space <em>V</em> is automatically a metric space
with the distance function
<em>d</em>(<em>v</em>,<em>w</em>):=||<em>v</em>-<em>w</em>||.
(This still holds if Homogeneity is replaced by the weaker axiom
||<em>v</em>||=||-<em>v</em>||.)

<p>

Two norms, say ||&middot;|| and [[&middot;]],
on a vector space are said to be <em>equivalent</em>
if there exist positive constants <em>C</em>,<em>C</em>'
such that ||<em>v</em>||&lt;=<em>C</em>[[<em>v</em>]]
and [[<em>v</em>]]&lt;=<em>C</em>'||<em>v</em>||
for all vectors&nbsp;<em>v</em>.
Equivalent norms yield the same notions of
open/closed/bounded/compact sets,
convergence, continuity and uniform continuity, and completeness.

<p>

<em>If V is finite-dimensional, all norms on V are equivalent.</em>
In particular, the above notions are canonically defined,
independent of choices of basis or norm (since we already know
that any finite-dimensional <em>F</em>-vector space already has
at least one norm).  Proof: First check that equivalence of norms
is in fact an equivalence relation.  It is then enough to fix one norm
||&middot;||, say the sup norm relative to some choice of basis,
and show that any other norm is equivalent to it.
Using homogeneity and subadditivity we see that
[[<em>v</em>]]&lt;=<em>C</em>'||<em>v</em>||
where <em>C</em>' is the sum of the [[&middot;]]-norms
of the unit vectors.  In particular, it follows that
the function [[&middot;]] is continuous in the ||&middot;||-metric.
The get the reverse inequality, first use homogeneity
to reduce it to the case of ||<em>v</em>||=1.
The set of such vectors <em>v</em> is closed and bounded,
hence compact by Heine-Borel.  The function 1/[[&middot;]]
on this set is continuous, because it is the multiplicative inverse
of a continuous function to the <em>positive</em> reals.
Hence it is bounded.  We may use an upper bound for <em>C</em>.

<p>

An infinite-dimensional vector space may have inequivalent norms.
For example, you can easily check that the sup and sum norms on
<em>F</em><sup>oo</sup> are not equivalent, and readily construct
many more pairwise inequivalent norms on this space.
