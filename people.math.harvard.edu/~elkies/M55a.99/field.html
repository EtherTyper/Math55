About the field and vector space axioms
</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ccffff">

The field axioms listed below describe the basic properties of
the four operations of arithmetic: ambition, distraction,
uglification, and derision.  [Don't blame me for this last;
it's due to C.L.Dodgson, a.k.a. Lewis Carroll.  Go
<A HREF="http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/wonderland/turtle.htm">here</A>
for the relevant quote from <EM>Alice</EM>.]  Actually,
only ambition and uglification -- er, addition and multiplication
-- are needed, together with additive and multiplicative inverses
and identities.

A <EM>field</EM>, then, is a set <EM>F</EM> equipped with:

<UL>
<LI> Two distinguished elements called 0 and 1, which must be different
<LI> A function from <EM>F</EM> to <EM>F</EM> called
 <EM>additive inverse</EM> and denoted by the unary minus sign
 (so the additive inverse of <EM>a</EM> is <EM>-a</EM>), and
 a function from <EM>F</EM>-{0} to <EM>F</EM>-{0}
 called <EM>multiplicative inverse</EM> that takes <EM>a</EM>
 to an element called <EM>a</EM><SUP>-1</SUP> (we shall usually
 write <EM>F<SUP>*</SUP></EM> for <EM>F</EM>-{0})
<LI> Two functions <EM>F</EM><SUP>2</SUP> to <EM>F</EM> called
 <EM>addition</EM> and <EM>multiplication</EM>; as usual we shall
 denote the images of (<EM>a,b</EM>) under these two functions by
 <EM>a + b</EM> and <EM>a*b</EM> (or simply <EM>ab</EM>).
</UL>

These must satisfy the following nine conditions, or axioms:

<P>

i) For all <EM>a</EM> in <EM>F</EM>, <EM>a</EM>+0=0+<EM>a=a</EM>
[i.e. 0 is an additive identity]
<BR>

ii) For all <EM>a</EM> in <EM>F</EM>,
<EM>a</EM>+(-<EM>a</EM>)=(-<EM>a</EM>)+<EM>a</EM>=0
[this is what ``additive inverse'' means]
<BR>

iii) For all <EM>a,b,c</EM> in <EM>F</EM>, <EM>a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c</EM>
[i.e. addition is associative]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Conditions (i), (ii), (iii) assert that (<EM>F</EM>,0,-,+) is
 a <EM>group</EM>.  Familiar consequences are the right and left
 <EM>cancellation rules</EM>: if, for any <EM>a,b,c</EM> in <EM>F</EM>,
 we have <EM>a+c=b+c</EM> or <EM>c+a=b+a</EM>, then <EM>a=b</EM>.
 This is proved by adding (<EM>-c</EM>) to both sides from the right
 or left respectively.  In particular, <EM>a+a=a</EM> if and only if
 <EM>a</EM>=0.  Likewise, for any <EM>a,b</EM> in <EM>F</EM>,
 the equation <EM>a+x=b</EM> has the unique solution
 <EM>x=b+(-a)</EM>, usually abbreviated <EM>x=b-a</EM>
 (do not confuse this binary operation of ``subtraction''
 with the unary additive inverse!).
 Another standard consequence of (iii) is that,
 for any <EM>a</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>a</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, ... ,
 <EM>a<SUB>n</SUB></EM> in <EM>F</EM>, the sum
 <EM>a</EM><SUB>1</SUB> + <EM>a</EM><SUB>2</SUB> + ... + <EM>a<SUB>n</SUB></EM>
 is the same no matter how it is parenthesized.  (In how many ways
 <EM>can</EM> that expression be parenthesized?)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

iv) For all <EM>a,b</EM> in <EM>F</EM>, <EM>a+b=b+a</EM>
[i.e. addition is commutative]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Conditions (i), (ii), (iii) assert that (<EM>F</EM>,0,-,+) is
 a <EM>commutative group</EM>, a.k.a. 
 <EM>abelian group</EM> or <EM>additive group</EM>.
 The first alias is a tribute to N.H.Abel (1802-1829);
 the second reflects the fact that in general one only uses ``+''
 for a group law when the group is commutative -- else multiplicative
 notation is almost always used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

v) For all <EM>a</EM> in <EM>F</EM>, <EM>a</EM>*1=1*<EM>a=a</EM>
[i.e. 1 is a multiplicative identity]
<BR>

vi) For all <EM>a</EM> in <EM>F</EM><SUP>*</SUP>,
<EM>a</EM>*<EM>a</EM><SUP>-1</SUP>=<EM>a</EM><SUP>-1</SUP>*<EM>a</EM>=1
[this is what ``multiplicative inverse'' means]
<BR>

vii) For all <EM>a,b,c</EM> in <EM>F</EM>, <EM>a(bc)=(ab)c</EM>
[i.e. multiplication is associative]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 In particular, restricting (v), (vi) and (vii) to
 <EM>F<SUP>*</SUP></EM>, we are asserting that 
 (<EM>F<SUP>*</SUP></EM>,1,<SUP>-1</SUP>,*) is a group.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

viii) For all <EM>a,b</EM> in <EM>F</EM>, <EM>ab=ba</EM>
[i.e. multiplication is commutative]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 So, the group (<EM>F<SUP>*</SUP></EM>,1,<SUP>-1</SUP>,*)
 is also abelian.  If <EM>F</EM> satisfies all the field axioms
 except (viii), it is called a <EM>skew field</EM>;
 the most famous example is the <EM>quaternions</EM> of
 W.R.Hamilton (1805-1865).  Much of linear algebra can
 still be done over skew fields, but we shall not pursue
 this in Math 55.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

ix) For all <EM>a,b,c</EM> in <EM>F</EM>,
<EM>a(b+c)=(ab)+(ac)</EM> and <EM>(a+b)c=(ac)+(bc)</EM>.
[distributive law.  The second part is of course redundant
by commutativity; it is required in the skew case.]

<P>

From (ix) together with the additive properties follows the
basic identity:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For all <EM>a</EM> in <EM>F</EM>, <EM>a</EM>*0=0*<EM>a</EM>=0.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<EM>Proof</EM>: apply the distributive law to <EM>a</EM>(0+0) and
(0+0)<EM>a</EM>, and use the fact that 0 is the only solution of
<EM>x+x=x</EM>.

<P>

Thus also:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For all <EM>a,b</EM> in <EM>F</EM>, <EM>ab</EM>=0 if and only if
<EM>a</EM>=0 or <EM>b</EM>=0 (or both).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<EM>Proof</EM>: If <EM>a</EM> is nonzero, multiply <EM>ab</EM>=0
by <EM>a</EM><SUP>-1</SUP> to conclude <EM>b</EM>=0.

<P>

That is, a field has no (nontrivial) zero divisors.

<P>

Note that (vi) is the only axiom using the multiplicative inverse.
If we drop the existence of multiplicative inverses and axiom (vi),
we obtain the structure of a <EM>ring</EM> (commutative with unity).
For example, <STRONG>Z</STRONG> is a ring which is not a field.
A ring may have nontrivial zero divisors (you have seen an
example of this already in class); if it does not, it is called
a <EM>domain</EM>.

<HR>

A <EM>vector space</EM> over a field <EM>F</EM> is an additive
group <EM>V</EM> (the ``vectors'') together with a function
(``scalar multiplication'') taking a field element (``scalar'')
and a vector to a vector, as long as this function satisfies the axioms

<UL>
<LI> 1*<EM>v=v</EM> for all <EM>v</EM> in <EM>V</EM>
[so 1 remains a multiplicative identity],
<LI> for all scalars <EM>a,b</EM> and all vectors <EM>u,v</EM> we have
<EM>a(u+v)=au+av</EM> and <EM>(a+b)u=au+bu</EM>
[distributive properties].
</UL>

Notice that these axioms do not use the multiplicative inverse;
they can thus be used equally when <EM>F</EM> is any ring,
in which case the resulting structure is called a <EM>module</EM>
over <EM>F</EM>.  But multiplicative inverses are used to prove
the basic theorems on vector spaces, so those theorems do not hold
in the more general setting of modules; for instance one cannot speak
of the dimension of a general module, even over <STRONG>Z</STRONG>.
