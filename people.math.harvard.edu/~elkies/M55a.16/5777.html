<h2>5777 and all that</h2>

October 3 was the Jewish New Year, first of Tishrei 5777.
It is unusually late (as will be the remaining Jewish holidays this year),
for reasons that relate to some neat arithmetical facts about 5777 and
its neighbors 5778 and 5776.

<p>

Math 55a alum
<a href="http://www.scottkom.com" target="_blank">Scott Kominers</a>
notes that 5777 = Floor(&varphi;<sup>18</sup>), where &varphi; is the
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio"
  target="_blank">golden ratio</a>&rdquo;
<nobr>(1 + 5<sup>&frac12;</sup>) / 2</nobr> = 1.61803&hellip;,
which is the positive root of
<nobr><em>x</em>&sup2; &minus; <em>x</em> &minus; 1</nobr>.
(The number 18 is regarded as auspicious in Judaism, being the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria"
  target="_blank">gematria</a> value of Hebrew
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chai_(symbol)"
  target="_blank"><font size="-1">CHAI</font></a> &#x5d7;&#x5d9; &ldquo;life, living&rdquo;.)

<p>

Numerically, <nobr>&varphi;<sup>18</sup> = 5777.9998269&hellip;</nobr>,
so the floor function is 5777 only barely; the difference
<nobr>5778 &minus; &varphi;<sup>18</sup></nobr> is exactly
<nobr>1 / &varphi;<sup>18</sup></nobr>.
The sum </nobr>&varphi;<sup>18</sup> + &varphi;<sup>&minus;18</sup></nobr>
is an integer &mdash; namely the 18th
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number"
  target="_blank">Lucas number</a> <em>L</em><sub>18</sub> &mdash; because
&minus;1/&varphi; is the algebraic conjugate 1&minus;&varphi; of&nbsp;&varphi;,
so <nobr>&varphi;<sup>18</sup> + &varphi;<sup>&minus;18</sup></nobr>
is the sum of <nobr>&varphi;<sup>18</sup></nobr> and its algebraic conjugate
(and thus the trace of <em>T</em><sup>18</sup> if <em>T</em> is
a linear operator on a two-dimensional space whose eigenvalues are
<nobr>&varphi; and <nobr>&minus;1/&varphi;</nobr>, such as
<nobr><em>T</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) = (<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>, <em>x</em>)</nobr> ).

<p>

Now  &varphi;<sup>18</sup> + &varphi;<sup>&minus;18</sup> =
(&varphi;<sup>9</sup> &minus; &varphi;<sup>&minus;9</sup>)<sup>2</sup> + 2
= L<sub>9</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2
(in general
<nobr>L<sub>2<em>m</em></sub>
 = L<sub><em>m</em></sub><sup>2</sup> &plusmn; 2</nobr>,
the sign depending on the parity of&nbsp;<em>m</em>);
and indeed the recently departed year was numbered 5776
which is a perfect square, indeed the only four-digit square
that ends with its own root.  Some context for this:
For each <nobr><em>r</em> = 1, 2, 3, &hellip;</nobr>
there are four &ldquo;idempotents&rdquo;
(solutions of <nobr><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>x</em></nobr>)
<nobr>mod 10<sup><em>r</em></sup></nobr>: the trivial 0 and&nbsp;1, and two
nontrivial solutions that sum to <nobr>1 mod 10<sup><em>r</em></sup></nobr>
(in general <em>x</em> is an idempotent in some ring if and only if
1&minus;<em>x</em> is an idempotent).
The two nontrivial idempotents can be recovered from the simultaneous
(&ldquo;Chinese remainder&rdquo;) congruences
<nobr><em>x</em> &equiv; 0 mod 2<sup><em>r</em></sup>,
<em>x</em> &equiv; 1 mod 5<sup><em>r</em></sup></nobr>
or
<nobr><em>x</em> &equiv; 1 mod 2<sup><em>r</em></sup>,
<em>x</em> &equiv; 0 mod 5<sup><em>r</em></sup></nobr>.
At least one of them exceeds <nobr>10<sup><em>r</em>&minus;&frac12;</sup></nobr>
and thus has a <nobr>2<em>r</em>-digit</nobr> square.  In our case of
<em>r</em>=2, this solution is 76,
which is both <nobr>0 mod 4</nobr> and <nobr>1 mod 25</nobr>.
The complementary idempotent 25 is not another example becuase
it is a bit under <nobr>10<sup>3/2</sup> = 31.62&hellip;</nobr>,
so instead is the unique root of a <nobr><em>three</em>-digit</nobr> square
(namely 625) that ends with its own root.

<p>

What has all this to do with the Jewish holidays?  Well 76,
besides being <em>L</em><sub>9</sub> and a <nobr>mod-100</nobr> idempotent,
is also <nobr>4 &middot; 19</nobr>, which makes
<nobr>5776 = 76<sup>2</sup></nobr> a multiple of&nbsp;19.
(It had to be, because 19 is prime and the Legendre symbol (5/19) is +1,
so <nobr>&varphi; and &minus;1/&varphi;</nobr> have
representatives mod&nbsp;19 in the &ldquo;prime field&rdquo;
<b>Z</b>/19<b>Z</b> &mdash; namely &minus;4 and 5, as it happens &mdash;
so their 18th powers are 1 by Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem,
whence their sum <em>L</em><sub>18</sub> is <nobr>2 mod 19</nobr>,
and <nobr><em>L</em><sub>18</sub> &minus; 2</nobr> is the square
<nobr>of <em>L</em><sub>9</sub></nobr>.)

<p>

Now 18 is auspicious in Judaism, but 19 is a key number in the
Jewish calendar, which has lunar months (the Hebrew &#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d7
can be read as either <font size="-1">YERACH</font> [month] or
<font size="-1">YAREACH</font> [moon(*)]),
but must not stray too far from the solar year because some of the
Jewish festivals are tied to the seasons (e.g.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavuot" target="_blank">Shavuot</a>
is a harvest festival, and during the week of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot" target="_blank">Sukkot</a>
one is to eat outside in a makeshift booth, which is tolerable this time
of the year but would be problematic in mid-winter).  But a lunar month
is about 29&frac12; days long, and a solar year about 365&frac14;,
longer than 12 lunar months but shorter than&nbsp;13.
So a &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar"
  target="_blank">lunisolar calendar</a>&rdquo; must combine years of
12 and 13 lunar months to keep synchronized on average with
the Earth&rsquo;s orbit around the Sun.

<blockquote>
(*) Indeed the English word &ldquo;month&rdquo;
is likewise related with &ldquo;moon&rdquo;, and for that matter
&ldquo;moon&rdquo; itself is sometimes used for &ldquo;month&rdquo;
as in &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; and &ldquo;many moons ago&rdquo;.
</blockquote>

What proportion of years must have a 13th month to maintain this
synchronization?  About 0.3683, using the lengths of the month and year
derived from the values in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle"
 target="_blank">this Wikipedia page</a>.  That is more accuracy than was
available thousands of years ago, but the ancients observed the Sun and Moon
long and accurately enough to find the excellent approximation
<nobr>7/19 = 0.3684&hellip;</nobr> to this ratio, meaning that
7 of every 19 years need a thirteenth month.  (Such an extra month is nowadays
called a &ldquo;leap month&rdquo;, making the year a &ldquo;leap year&rdquo;;
in Hebrew a <nobr>13-month</nobr> year is known somewhat quaintly as a
&ldquo;pregnant year&rdquo;
[<nobr>&#x5e9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4; &#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;</nobr>
= <font size="-1">SHANAH M</font>&#x0259;<font size="-1">UBERET</font>].)
 <!-- that &#x0259; is a schwa -->
So, to know whether Year&nbsp;<em>N</em> was a leap year
you need to know <nobr><em>N</em> mod 19</nobr>.
For those <em>N</em>, The Jewish New Year and other Tishrei holidays
(Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Shmini Atzeret) come late in the solar calendar
on the <em>following</em> year, <em>N</em>+1.

<p>

Of course we need to also know which 7 years in each cycle of&nbsp;19
get the extra month.  They are spread as evenly as possible over the cycle,
which specifies the pattern uniquely, but only up to translation mod&nbsp;19.
The Babylonians chose years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and&nbsp;19
of each <nobr>19-year</nobr> cycle, and the Jewish calendar retains
this choice
(known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle"
 target="_blank">Metonic cycle</a>,
though it was already known in Babylonia and China when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meton_of_Athens"
 target="_blank">Meton of Athens</a> found the 7/19 approximation).
So usually leap years are spaced three apart, but twice in each cycle
they come closer, and then the next year starts even later than usual.
Since 5776 is a multiple of&nbsp;19, we&rsquo;ve just had one of these
close pairs (17/19), so Rosh Ha-Shanah and the rest are pushed even
further back.

<p>

The &ldquo;Metonic cycle&rdquo; affects not just the solar date but also the
start and end time of the Jewish holidays, because they are celebrated from
sundown to sundown, so for example Rosh Ha-Shanah 5777 actually started
at sundown the evening of the last day of&nbsp;5776.  (This already appears
in the first chapter of Exodus, where each day of Creation concludes with
the formula <font size="-1">VAYHI-EREV VAYHI-VOKER</font>
&ldquo;and there was evening and there was morning&rdquo;,
<em>in that order</em>; <font size="-1">EREV</font> is thus used for the
&ldquo;Eve&rdquo; of a holiday, as in <font size="-1">EREV SHABBAT</font> =
Friday evening.  Note that
&ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Eve&rdquo; = December&nbsp;31 works the same way,
and likewise for other &ldquo;Eves&rdquo;.)  In this part of the year,
and in our Northern Hemisphere, later in the calendar means
earlier sundowns.  We are near the equinox (Sep.22), when the days
are getting shorter most quickly.  This also means that each
sundown-to-sundown interval is a bit less than 24 hours.
The shortest possible Yom Kippur fast would be when the day falls
exactly on the equinox; afterwards the fasts get longer as the
days keep getting shorter.  But this effect is negligible:
even at the equinox the interval between sundowns is not as much as
2&nbsp;minutes less than 24 hours, and the <em>difference</em> between
that minimal interval and what we have this year is measured in seconds.

Further notes:

<ol>
<li> Scott explains that he found the formula
<nobr>5777 = Floor(&varphi;<sup>18</sup>)</nobr>
simply by entering 5777 into the
<a href="http://oeis.org" target="_blank">OEIS</a> search window;
indeed the second hit is
<a href="http://oeis.org/A014217" target="_blank">Sequence A014217</a>,
whose <nobr><em>n</em>-th</nobr> term is
<nobr>Floor(&varphi;<sup><em>n</em></sup>)</nobr>.
(The first hit is
<a href="http://oeis.org/A053755" target="_blank">Sequence A053755</a>,
whose <nobr><em>n</em>-th</nobr> term is
<nobr>4<em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1</nobr>; most of the
<a href="http://oeis.org/search?q=5777" target="_blank">other top hits</a>
involve Fibonacci/Lucas/&varphi; matters, including
<nobr>5777 = <em>F</em><sub>27</sub> / <em>F</em><sub>9</sub></nobr>
and the fact that 5777 is the sixth-smallest
<a href="http://oeis.org/A005845" target="_blank">Lucas pseudoprime</a>.)

<li> The Hebrew calendar actually inserts the 13th month in the
<em>middle</em> of the year: instead of the sixth month Adar
it&rsquo;s Adar&nbsp;Aleph and Adar&nbsp;Beth.  [Adar <em>used</em> to be
the last month; the Biblical name for the 1&nbsp;Tishrei holiday is
<font size="-1">YOM TRUAH</font> (&ldquo;day of the [shofar] blast&rdquo;),
not Rosh Ha-Shanah (New Year, literally &ldquo;head of the year&rdquo;).]
That means that Passover (7th month) and all later holidays are already
delayed in the leap year itself.  So is Purim, which falls in Adar,
and is celebrated on Adar&nbsp;Beth on leap years,
though the corresponding day in Adar&nbsp;Aleph is still recognized as
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim#Purim_Katan"
 target="_blank">Purim Katan</a>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Little Purim&rdquo;)
and marked by minor observances.

<li> Since a lunar month is about 29&frac12; days, the months of the
Hebrew calendar usually alternate between 30 and 29 days.  But the
second and third months, normally 29+30, sometimes go 29+29 or 30+30,
either to compensate for the discrepancy between 29&frac12; and the
actual astronomical period of about 29.53 days, or to prevent
ritually awkward coincidences (such as Yom Kippur falling
the day before or after Shabbat).  So there are not two but six
possible lengths of a Jewish year: 353/354/355 for a common year,
383/384/385 for a leap year.  See for instance
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar"
 target="_blank">Wikipedia&rsquo;s extensive page</a> on the Hebrew calendar.
It is sometimes claimed that the alignment of the Jewish and the
common (Gregorian) calendar, and/or the Jewish calendar and the week,
repeats <em>exactly</em> every 19 years, so that your
19th, 38th, 57th, &hellip; Jewish birthday always coincides with the
common birthday, and/or falls on the same weekday; but this is
a misconception: there is neither a condition nor a consequence of
the (complicated) rules of the Jewish calendar that forces
such a coincidence.  For example, 19 years ago Rosh Ha-Shanah fell on
  <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/hebcal/?year=1997&v=1&month=x&yt=G&nh=on&nx=on&i=&c=off#cal-1997-10"
   target="_blank">Thursday, October&nbsp;2</a>,
while this year&rsquo;s was Monday the&nbsp;3rd.

<li> The pattern of 3- and 2-year intervals between leap years is the same
as the pattern of whole and half notes in a major scale: starting from C/0,
two long gaps (C-D-E/0-3-6) and a short one (E-F/6-8),
three long gaps (F-G-A-B/8-11-14-17) and a short one (B-C/17-19).
That makes sense because 19/7 is 1 more than the ratio 12/7 of
the lengths of the chromatic and diatonic scales, which in turn arises as
an approximation to <nobr>log(2) / log(1.5)</nobr>.
So our solar-lunar discrepancy of about 0.3684 is close to
<nobr>log(1.5) / log(3) &approx; 0.3691</nobr>.
<em>That</em>&nbsp;numerical approximation is surely pure coincidence,
though it does afford a nice mnemonic for the leap-year pattern
(which I noticed independently, but see now is also mentioned on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar"
 target="_blank">that Wikipedia page</a>).
